    "Your first task is to scrape Presidential Debates from the Commission of Presidential Debates website: http://www.debates.org/index.php?page=debate-transcripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, you are not allowed to manually look up the URLs that you need, instead you have to scrape them. The root url to be scraped is the one listed above, namely: http://www.debates.org/index.php?page=debate-transcripts\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. By using `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` find all the links / URLs on the website that links to transcriptions of **First Presidential Debates** from the years [2012, 2008, 2004, 2000, 1996, 1988, 1984, 1976, 1960]. In total you should find 9 links / URLs tat fulfill this criteria.\n",
    "2. When you have a list of the URLs your task is to create a Data Frame with some statistics (see example of output below):\n",
    "    1. Scrape the title of each link and use that as the column name in your Data Frame. \n",
    "    2. Count how long the transcript of the debate is (as in the number of characters in transcription string). Feel free to include `\\` characters in your count, but remove any breakline characters, i.e. `\\n`. You will get credit if your count is +/- 10% from our result.\n",
    "    3. Count how many times the word **war** was used in the different debates. Note that you have to convert the text in a smart way (to not count the word **warranty** for example, but counting **war.**, **war!**, **war,** or **War** etc.\n",
    "    4. Also scrape the most common used word in the debate, and write how many times it was used. Note that you have to use the same strategy as in 3 in order to do this.\n",

MITT ROMNEY, R-MASS., PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, PARTICIPATE IN A CANDIDATES DEBATE, UNIVERSITY OF DENVER, COLORADOOCTOBER 3, 2012SPEAKERS: FORMER GOV. MITT ROMNEY, R-MASS.PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMAJIM LEHRER, MODERATORLEHRER: Good evening from the Magness Arena at the University of Denver in Denver, Colorado. I\\'m Jim Lehrer of the \"PBS NewsHour,\" and I welcome you to the first of the 2012 presidential debates between President Barack Obama, the Democratic nominee, and former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee.LEHRER: This debate and the next three -- two presidential, one vice presidential -- are sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. Tonight\\'s 90 minutes will be about domestic issues and will follow a format designed by the commission. There will be six roughly 15-minute segments with two-minute answers for the first question, then open discussion for the remainder of each segment.Thousands of people offered suggestions on segment subjects or questions via the Internet and other means, but I made the final selections. And for the record, they were not submitted for approval to the commission or the candidates.The segments as I announced in advance will be three on the economy and one each on health care, the role of government and governing, with an emphasis throughout on differences, specifics and choices. Both candidates will also have two-minute closing statements.The audience here in the hall has promised to remain silent -- no cheers, applause, boos, hisses, among other noisy distracting things, so we may all concentrate on what the candidates have to say. There is a noise exception right now, though, as we welcome President Obama and Governor Romney.(APPLAUSE)Gentlemen, welcome to you both. Let\\'s start the economy, segment one, and let\\'s begin with jobs. What are the major differences between the two of you about how you would go about creating new jobs?LEHRER: You have two minutes. Each of you have two minutes to start. A coin toss has determined, Mr. President, you go first.OBAMA: Well, thank you very much, Jim, for this opportunity. I want to thank Governor Romney and the University of Denver for your hospitality.There are a lot of points I want to make tonight, but the most important one is that 20 years ago I became the luckiest man on Earth because Michelle Obama agreed to marry me.And so I just want to wish, Sweetie, you happy anniversary and let you know that a year from now we will not be celebrating it in front of 40 million people.(LAUGHTER)You know, four years ago we went through the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. Millions of jobs were lost, the auto industry was on the brink of collapse. The financial system had frozen up.And because of the resilience and the determination of the American people, we\\'ve begun to fight our way back. Over the last 30 months, we\\'ve seen 5 million jobs in the private sector created. The auto industry has come roaring back. And housing has begun to rise.But we all know that we\\'ve still got a lot of work to do. And so the question here tonight is not where we\\'ve been, but where we\\'re going.Governor Romney has a perspective that says if we cut taxes, skewed towards the wealthy, and roll back regulations, that we\\'ll be better off. I\\'ve got a different view.I think we\\'ve got to invest in education and training. I think it\\'s important for us to develop new sources of energy here in America, that we change our tax code to make sure that we\\'re helping small businesses and companies that are investing here in the United States, that we take some of the money that we\\'re saving as we wind down two wars to rebuild America and that we reduce our deficit in a balanced way that allows us to make these critical investments.Now, it ultimately is going to be up to the voters -- to you -- which path we should take. Are we going to double on top-down economic policies that helped to get us into this mess or do we embrace a new economic patriotism that says America does best when the middle class does best? And I\\'m looking forward to having that debate.LEHRER: Governor Romney, two minutes.ROMNEY: Thank you, Jim. It\\'s an honor to be here with you, and I appreciate the chance to be with the president. I\\'m pleased to be at the University of Denver, appreciate their welcome, and also the Presidential Commission on these debates.And congratulations to you, Mr. President, on your anniversary. I\\'m sure this was the most romantic place you could imagine, here -- here with me. So I...(LAUGHTER)Congratulations.This is obviously a very tender topic. I\\'ve had the occasion over the last couple of years of meeting people across the country. I was in Dayton, Ohio, and a woman grabbed my arm and she said, \"I\\'ve been out of work since May. Can you help me?\"Ann yesterday was at a rally in Denver and a woman came up to her with a baby in her arms and said, \"Ann, my husband has had four jobs in three years, part-time jobs. He\\'s lost his most recent job and we\\'ve now just lost our home. Can you help us?\"And the answer is, yes, we can help, but it\\'s going to take a different path. Not the one we\\'ve been on, not the one the president describes as a top-down, cut taxes for the rich. That\\'s not what I\\'m going to do.My plan has five basic parts. One, get us energy independent, North American energy independent. That creates about 4 million jobs.Number two, open up more trade, particularly in Latin America. Crack down on China, if and when they cheat.Number three, make sure our people have the skills they need to succeed and the best schools in the world. We\\'re far away from that now.Number four, get to us a balanced budget.Number five, champion small business. It\\'s small business that creates the jobs in America, and over the last four years, small business people have decided that America may not be the place to open a new business because new business startups are down to a 30-year low.ROMNEY: Now, I\\'m concerned that the path that we\\'re on has just been unsuccessful. The president has a view very similar to the view he had when he ran four years, that a bigger government, spending more, taxing more, regulating more -- if you will, trickle-down government -- would work.That\\'s not the right answer for America. I\\'ll restore the vitality that gets America working again. Thank you.LEHRER: Mr. President, please respond directly to what the governor just said about trickle-down -- his trick-down approach, as he said yours is.OBAMA: Well, let me talk specifically about what I think we need to do. First, we\\'ve got to improve our education system and we\\'ve made enormous progress drawing on ideas both from Democrats and Republicans that are already starting to show gains in some of the toughest to deal with schools. We\\'ve got a program called Race to the Top that has prompted reforms in 46 states around the country, raising standards, improving how we train teachers.So now I want to hire another 100,000 new math and science teachers, and create 2 million more slots in our community colleges so that people can get trained for the jobs that are out there right now. And I want to make sure that we keep tuition low for our young people.When it comes to our tax code, Governor Romney and I both agree that our corporate tax rate is too high, so I want to lower it, particularly for manufacturing, taking it down to 25 percent. But I also want to close those loopholes that are giving incentives for companies that are shipping jobs overseas. I want to provide tax breaks for companies that are investing here in the United States.On energy, Governor Romney and I, we both agree that we\\'ve got to boost American energy production, and oil and natural gas production are higher than they\\'ve been in years. But I also believe that we\\'ve got to look at the energy sources of the future, like wind and solar and biofuels, and make those investments.OBAMA: So all of this is possible. Now, in order for us to do it, we do have to close our deficit, and one of the things I\\'m sure we\\'ll be discussing tonight is, how do we deal with our tax code? And how do we make sure that we are reducing spending in a responsible way, but also, how do we have enough revenue to make those investments?And this is where there\\'s a difference, because Governor Romney\\'s central economic plan calls for a $5 trillion tax cut -- on top of the extension of the Bush tax cuts -- that\\'s another trillion dollars -- and $2 trillion in additional military spending that the military hasn\\'t asked for. That\\'s $8 trillion. How we pay for that, reduce the deficit, and make the investments that we need to make, without dumping those costs onto middle-class Americans, I think is one of the central questions of this campaign.LEHRER: Both of you have spoken about a lot of different things, and we\\'re going to try to get through them in as specific a way as we possibly can.But, first, Governor Romney, do you have a question that you\\'d like to ask the president directly about something he just said?ROMNEY: Well, sure. I\\'d like to clear up the record and go through it piece by piece.First of all, I don\\'t have a $5 trillion tax cut. I don\\'t have a tax cut of a scale that you\\'re talking about. My view is that we ought to provide tax relief to people in the middle class. But I\\'m not going to reduce the share of taxes paid by high-income people. High-income people are doing just fine in this economy. They\\'ll do fine whether you\\'re president or I am.The people who are having the hard time right now are middle- income Americans. Under the president\\'s policies, middle-income Americans have been buried. They\\'re just being crushed. Middle- income Americans have seen their income come down by $4,300. This is a -- this is a tax in and of itself. I\\'ll call it the economy tax. It\\'s been crushing.At the same time, gasoline prices have doubled under the president. Electric rates are up. Food prices are up. Health care costs have gone up by $2,500 a family. Middle-income families are being crushed.ROMNEY: And so the question is how to get them going again. And I\\'ve described it. It\\'s energy and trade, the right kind of training programs, balancing our budget and helping small business. Those are the -- the cornerstones of my plan.But the president mentioned a couple of other ideas I\\'ll just note. First, education. I agree: Education is key, particularly the future of our economy. But our training programs right now, we\\'ve got 47 of them, housed in the federal government, reporting to eight different agencies. Overhead is overwhelming. We\\'ve got to get those dollars back to the states and go to the workers so they can create their own pathways to get in the training they need for jobs that will really help them.The second area, taxation, we agree, we ought to bring the tax rates down. And I do, both for corporations and for individuals. But in order for us not to lose revenue, have the government run out of money, I also lower deductions and credits and exemptions, so that we keep taking in the same money when you also account for growth.The third area, energy. Energy is critical, and the president pointed out correctly that production of oil and gas in the U.S. is up. But not due to his policies. In spite of his policies.Mr. President, all of the increase in natural gas and oil has happened on private land, not on government land. On government land, your administration has cut the number of permits and licenses in half. If I\\'m president, I\\'ll double them, and also get the -- the oil from offshore and Alaska. And I\\'ll bring that pipeline in from Canada.And, by the way, I like coal. I\\'m going to make sure we can continue to burn clean coal. People in the coal industry feel like it\\'s getting crushed by your policies. I want to get America and North America energy independent so we can create those jobs.And finally, with regards to that tax cut, look, I\\'m not looking to cut massive taxes and to reduce the -- the revenues going to the government. My -- my number-one principal is, there will be no tax cut that adds to the deficit. I want to underline that: no tax cut that adds to the deficit.But I do want to reduce the burden being paid by middle-income Americans. And I -- and to do that, that also means I cannot reduce the burden paid by high-income Americans. So any -- any language to the contrary is simply not accurate. LEHRER: Mr. President?OBAMA: Well, I think -- let\\'s talk about taxes, because I think it\\'s instructive. Now, four years ago, when I stood on this stage, I said that I would cut taxes for middle-class families. And that\\'s exactly what I did. We cut taxes for middle-class families by about $3,600.And the reason is, because I believe that we do best when the middle class is doing well. And by giving them those tax cuts, they had a little more money in their pocket, and so maybe they can buy a new car. They are certainly in a better position to weather the extraordinary recession that we went through. They can buy a computer for their kid who\\'s going off to college, which means they\\'re spending more money, businesses have more customers, businesses make more profits, and then hire more workers.Now, Governor Romney\\'s proposal that he has been promoting for 18 months calls for a $5 trillion tax cut, on top of $2 trillion of additional spending for our military. And he is saying that he is going to pay for it by closing loopholes and deductions. The problem is that he\\'s been asked over 100 times how you would close those deductions and loopholes, and he hasn\\'t been able to identify them.But I\\'m going to make an important point here, Jim.LEHRER: All right.OBAMA: When you add up all the loopholes and deductions that upper-income individuals can -- are currently taking advantage of, you take those all away, you don\\'t come close to paying for $5 trillion in tax cuts and $2 trillion in additional military spending.OBAMA: And that\\'s why independent studies looking at this said the only way to meet Governor Romney\\'s pledge of not reducing the deficit or -- or -- or not adding to the deficit is by burdening middle-class families. The average middle-class family with children would pay about $2,000 more.Now, that\\'s not my analysis. That\\'s the analysis of economists who have looked at this. And -- and that kind of top -- top-down economics, where folks at the top are doing well, so the average person making $3 million is getting a $250,000 tax break, while middle-class families are burdened further, that\\'s not what I believe is a recipe for economic growth.LEHRER: All right. What is the difference? Let\\'s just stay on taxes.(CROSSTALK)LEHRER: Just -- let\\'s just stay on taxes for (inaudible).(CROSSTALK)LEHRER: What is the difference...ROMNEY: Well, but -- but virtually -- virtually everything he just said about my tax plan is inaccurate.LEHRER: All right.ROMNEY: So if the tax plan he described were a tax plan I was asked to support, I\\'d say absolutely not. I\\'m not looking for a $5 trillion tax cut. What I\\'ve said is I won\\'t put in place a tax cut that adds to the deficit. That\\'s part one. So there\\'s no economist that can say Mitt Romney\\'s tax plan adds $5 trillion if I say I will not add to the deficit with my tax plan.Number two, I will not reduce the share paid by high-income individuals. I know that you and your running mate keep saying that and I know it\\'s a popular thing to say with a lot of people, but it\\'s just not the case. Look, I\\'ve got five boys. I\\'m used to people saying something that\\'s not always true, but just keep on repeating it and ultimately hoping I\\'ll believe it. But that -- that is not the case. All right? I will not reduce the taxes paid by high-income Americans.And number three, I will not under any circumstances raise taxes on middle-income families. I will lower taxes on middle-income families. Now, you cite a study. There are six other studies that looked at the study you describe and say it\\'s completely wrong. I saw a study that came out today that said you\\'re going to raise taxes by $3,000 to $4,000 on middle-income families.There are all these studies out there. But let\\'s get at the bottom line. That is, I want to bring down rates. I want to bring the rates down, at the same time lower deductions and exemptions and credits and so forth, so we keep getting the revenue we need. And you\\'d think, well, then why lower the rates?ROMNEY: And the reason is because small business pays that individual rate; 54 percent of America\\'s workers work in businesses that are taxed not at the corporate tax rate, but at the individual tax rate. And if we lower that rate, they will be able to hire more people. For me, this is about jobs. This is about getting jobs for the American people.(CROSSTALK)LEHRER: That\\'s where we started. Yeah.Do you challenge what the governor just said about his own plan?OBAMA: Well, for 18 months he\\'s been running on this tax plan. And now, five weeks before the election, he\\'s saying that his big, bold idea is, \"Never mind.\"And the fact is that if you are lowering the rates the way you described, Governor, then it is not possible to come up with enough deductions and loopholes that only affect high-income individuals to avoid either raising the deficit or burdening the middle class. It\\'s -- it\\'s math. It\\'s arithmetic.Now, Governor Romney and I do share a deep interest in encouraging small-business growth. So at the same time that my tax plan has already lowered taxes for 98 percent of families, I also lowered taxes for small businesses 18 times. And what I want to do is continue the tax rates -- the tax cuts that we put into place for small businesses and families.But I have said that for incomes over $250,000 a year, that we should go back to the rates that we had when Bill Clinton was president, when we created 23 million new jobs, went from deficit to surplus, and created a whole lot of millionaires to boot.And the reason this is important is because by doing that, we cannot only reduce the deficit, we cannot only encourage job growth through small businesses, but we\\'re also able to make the investments that are necessary in education or in energy.OBAMA: And we do have a difference, though, when it comes to definitions of small business. Under -- under my plan, 97 percent of small businesses would not see their income taxes go up. Governor Romney says, well, those top 3 percent, they\\'re the job creators, they\\'d be burdened.But under Governor Romney\\'s definition, there are a whole bunch of millionaires and billionaires who are small businesses. Donald Trump is a small business. Now, I know Donald Trump doesn\\'t like to think of himself as small anything, but -- but that\\'s how you define small businesses if you\\'re getting business income.And that kind of approach, I believe, will not grow our economy, because the only way to pay for it without either burdening the middle class or blowing up our deficit is to make drastic cuts in things like education, making sure that we are continuing to invest in basic science and research, all the things that are helping America grow. And I think that would be a mistake.LEHRER: All right.ROMNEY: Jim, let me just come back on that -- on that point, which is these...LEHRER: Just for the -- just for record...(CROSSTALK)ROMNEY: ... the small businesses we\\'re talking about...LEHRER: Excuse me. Excuse me. Just so everybody understands, we\\'re way over our first 15 minutes.ROMNEY: It\\'s fun, isn\\'t it?LEHRER: It\\'s OK, it\\'s great. No problem. Well, you all don\\'t have -- you don\\'t have a problem, I don\\'t have a problem, because we\\'re still on the economy. We\\'re going to come back to taxes. I want move on to the deficit and a lot of other things, too.OK, but go ahead, sir.ROMNEY: You bet. Well, President, you\\'re -- Mr. President, you\\'re absolutely right, which is that, with regards to 97 percent of the businesses are not -- not taxed at the 35 percent tax rate, they\\'re taxed at a lower rate. But those businesses that are in the last 3 percent of businesses happen to employ half -- half of all the people who work in small business. Those are the businesses that employ one-quarter of all the workers in America. And your plan is to take their tax rate from 35 percent to 40 percent.Now, and -- and I\\'ve talked to a guy who has a very small business. He\\'s in the electronics business in -- in St. Louis. He has four employees. He said he and his son calculated how much they pay in taxes, federal income tax, federal payroll tax, state income tax, state sales tax, state property tax, gasoline tax. It added up to well over 50 percent of what they earned. And your plan is to take the tax rate on successful small businesses from 35 percent to 40 percent. The National Federation of Independent Businesses has said that will cost 700,000 jobs.I don\\'t want to cost jobs. My priority is jobs. And so what I do is I bring down the tax rates, lower deductions and exemptions, the same idea behind Bowles-Simpson, by the way, get the rates down, lower deductions and exemptions, to create more jobs, because there\\'s nothing better for getting us to a balanced budget than having more people working, earning more money, paying more taxes. That\\'s by far the most effective and efficient way to get this budget balanced.OBAMA: Jim, I -- you may want to move onto another topic, but I -- I would just say this to the American people. If you believe that we can cut taxes by $5 trillion and add $2 trillion in additional spending that the military is not asking for, $7 trillion -- just to give you a sense, over 10 years, that\\'s more than our entire defense budget -- and you think that by closing loopholes and deductions for the well-to-do, somehow you will not end up picking up the tab, then Governor Romney\\'s plan may work for you.But I think math, common sense, and our history shows us that\\'s not a recipe for job growth. Look, we\\'ve tried this. We\\'ve tried both approaches. The approach that Governor Romney\\'s talking about is the same sales pitch that was made in 2001 and 2003, and we ended up with the slowest job growth in 50 years, we ended up moving from surplus to deficits, and it all culminated in the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.OBAMA: Bill Clinton tried the approach that I\\'m talking about. We created 23 million new jobs. We went from deficit to surplus. And businesses did very well. So, in some ways, we\\'ve got some data on which approach is more likely to create jobs and opportunity for Americans and I believe that the economy works best when middle-class families are getting tax breaks so that they\\'ve got some money in their pockets, and those of us who have done extraordinarily well because of this magnificent country that we live in, that we can afford to do a little bit more to make sure we\\'re not blowing up the deficit.ROMNEY: Jim, the president began this segment, so I think I get the last word.(CROSSTALK)LEHRER: Well, you\\'re going to get the first word in the next segment.ROMNEY: All right. Well, but he gets the first word of that segment. I get the last word (inaudible) I hope. Let me just make this comment.(CROSSTALK)ROMNEY: I think first of all, let me -- let me repeat -- let me repeat what I said. I\\'m not in favor of a $5 trillion tax cut. That\\'s not my plan. My plan is not to put in place any tax cut that will add to the deficit. That\\'s point one.So you may keep referring to it as a $5 trillion tax cut, but that\\'s not my plan.Number two, let\\'s look at history. My plan is not like anything that\\'s been tried before. My plan is to bring down rates, but also bring down deductions and exemptions and credits at the same time so the revenue stays in, but that we bring down rates to get more people working.My priority is putting people back to work in America. They\\'re suffering in this country. And we talk about evidence. Look at the evidence of the last four years. It\\'s absolutely extraordinary. We\\'ve got 23 million people out of work or stopped looking for work in this country. It\\'s just -- it\\'s -- we\\'ve got -- when the president took office, 32 million people on food stamps; 47 million on food stamps today; economic growth this year slower than last year, and last year slower than the year before.Going forward with the status quo is not going to cut it for the American people who are struggling today.LEHRER: All right. Let\\'s talk -- we\\'re still on the economy. This is, theoretically now, a second segment still on the economy, and specifically on what to do about the federal deficit, the federal debt.And the question, you each have two minutes on this, and Governor Romney, you -- you go first because the president went first on segment one. And the question is this, what are the differences between the two of you as to how you would go about tackling the deficit problem in this country?ROMNEY: Good. I\\'m glad you raised that, and it\\'s a -- it\\'s a critical issue. I think it\\'s not just an economic issue, I think it\\'s a moral issue. I think it\\'s, frankly, not moral for my generation to keep spending massively more than we take in, knowing those burdens are going to be passed on to the next generation and they\\'re going to be paying the interest and the principal all their lives.And the amount of debt we\\'re adding, at a trillion a year, is simply not moral.So how do we deal with it? Well, mathematically, there are three ways that you can cut a deficit. One, of course, is to raise taxes. Number two is to cut spending. And number is to grow the economy, because if more people work in a growing economy, they\\'re paying taxes, and you can get the job done that way.The presidents would -- president would prefer raising taxes. I understand. The problem with raising taxes is that it slows down the rate of growth. And you could never quite get the job done. I want to lower spending and encourage economic growth at the same time.What things would I cut from spending? Well, first of all, I will eliminate all programs by this test, if they don\\'t pass it: Is the program so critical it\\'s worth borrowing money from China to pay for it? And if not, I\\'ll get rid of it. Obamacare\\'s on my list.I apologize, Mr. President. I use that term with all respect, by the way.OBAMA: I like it.ROMNEY: Good. OK, good. So I\\'ll get rid of that.I\\'m sorry, Jim, I\\'m going to stop the subsidy to PBS. I\\'m going to stop other things. I like PBS, I love Big Bird. Actually like you, too. But I\\'m not going to -- I\\'m not going to keep on spending money on things to borrow money from China to pay for. That\\'s number one.Number two, I\\'ll take programs that are currently good programs but I think could be run more efficiently at the state level and send them to the state.ROMNEY: Number three, I\\'ll make government more efficient and to cut back the number of employees, combine some agencies and departments. My cutbacks will be done through attrition, by the way.This is the approach we have to take to get America to a balanced budget.The president said he\\'d cut the deficit in half. Unfortunately, he doubled it. Trillion-dollar deficits for the last four years. The president\\'s put it in place as much public debt -- almost as much debt held by the public as al prior presidents combined.LEHRER: Mr. President, two minutes.OBAMA: When I walked into the Oval Office, I had more than a trillion-dollar deficit greeting me. And we know where it came from: two wars that were paid for on a credit card; two tax cuts that were not paid for; and a whole bunch of programs that were not paid for; and then a massive economic crisis.And despite that, what we\\'ve said is, yes, we had to take some initial emergency measures to make sure we didn\\'t slip into a Great Depression, but what we\\'ve also said is, let\\'s make sure that we are cutting out those things that are not helping us grow.So 77 government programs, everything from aircrafts that the Air Force had ordered but weren\\'t working very well, 18 government -- 18 government programs for education that were well-intentioned, not weren\\'t helping kids learn, we went after medical fraud in Medicare and Medicaid very aggressively, more aggressively than ever before, and have saved tens of billions of dollars, $50 billion of waste taken out of the system.And I worked with Democrats and Republicans to cut a trillion dollars out of our discretionary domestic budget. That\\'s the largest cut in the discretionary domestic budget since Dwight Eisenhower.Now, we all know that we\\'ve got to do more. And so I\\'ve put forward a specific $4 trillion deficit reduction plan. It\\'s on a website. You can look at all the numbers, what cuts we make and what revenue we raise.And the way we do it is $2.50 for every cut, we ask for $1 of additional revenue, paid for, as I indicated earlier, by asking those of us who have done very well in this country to contribute a little bit more to reduce the deficit. Governor Romney earlier mentioned the Bowles-Simpson commission. Well, that\\'s how the commission -- bipartisan commission that talked about how we should move forward suggested we have to do it, in a balanced way with some revenue and some spending cuts. And this is a major difference that Governor Romney and I have.Let -- let me just finish their point, because you\\'re looking for contrast. You know, when Governor Romney stood on a stage with other Republican candidates for the nomination and he was asked, would you take $10 of spending cuts for just $1 of revenue? And he said no.Now, if you take such an unbalanced approach, then that means you are going to be gutting our investments in schools and education. It means that Governor Romney...(CROSSTALK)OBAMA: ... talked about Medicaid and how we could send it back to the states, but effectively this means a 30 percent cut in the primary program we help for seniors who are in nursing homes, for kids who are with disabilities.LEHRER: Mr. President, I\\'m sorry.OBAMA: And -- and that is not a right strategy for us to move forward.LEHRER: Way over the two minutes.OBAMA: Sorry.LEHRER: Governor, what about Simpson-Bowles? Do you support Simpson-Bowles?ROMNEY: Simpson-Bowles, the president should have grabbed that.LEHRER: No, I mean, do you support Simpson-Bowles?ROMNEY: I have my own plan. It\\'s not the same as Simpson- Bowles. But in my view, the president should have grabbed it. If you wanted to make some adjustments to it, take it, go to Congress, fight for it.OBAMA: That\\'s what we\\'ve done, made some adjustments to it, and we\\'re putting it forward before Congress right now, a $4 trillion plan...ROMNEY: But you\\'ve been -- but you\\'ve been president four years...(CROSSTALK)ROMNEY: You\\'ve been president four years. You said you\\'d cut the deficit in half. It\\'s now four years later. We still have trillion-dollar deficits. The CBO says we\\'ll have a trillion-dollar deficit each of the next four years. If you\\'re re-elected, we\\'ll get to a trillion-dollar debt.ROMNEY: I mean, you have said before you\\'d cut the deficit in half. And this -- I love this idea of $4 trillion in cuts. You found $4 trillion of ways to reduce or to get closer to a balanced budget, except we still show trillion-dollar deficits every year. That doesn\\'t get the job done.Let me come back and say, why is it that I don\\'t want to raise taxes? Why don\\'t I want to raise taxes on people? And actually, you said it back in 2010. You said, \"Look, I\\'m going to extend the tax policies that we have now; I\\'m not going to raise taxes on anyone, because when the economy is growing slow like this, when we\\'re in recession, you shouldn\\'t raise taxes on anyone.\"Well, the economy is still growing slow. As a matter of fact, it\\'s growing much more slowly now than when you made that statement. And so if you believe the same thing, you just don\\'t want to raise taxes on people. And the reality is it\\'s not just wealthy people -- you mentioned Donald Trump. It\\'s not just Donald Trump you\\'re taxing. It\\'s all those businesses that employ one-quarter of the workers in America; these small businesses that are taxed as individuals.You raise taxes and you kill jobs. That\\'s why the National Federation of Independent Businesses said your plan will kill 700,000 jobs. I don\\'t want to kill jobs in this environment.I\\'ll make one more point.(CROSSTALK)LEHRER: (inaudible) answer the taxes thing for a moment.ROMNEY: OK.LEHRER: Mr. President?OBAMA: Well, we\\'ve had this discussion before.LEHRER: About the idea that in order to reduce the deficit, there has to be revenue in addition to cuts.OBAMA: There has to be revenue in addition to cuts. Now, Governor Romney has ruled out revenue. He\\'s ruled out revenue.(CROSSTALK)ROMNEY: Absolutely. (CROSSTALK)ROMNEY: Look, the revenue I get is by more people working, getting higher pay, paying more taxes. That\\'s how we get growth and how we balance the budget. But the idea of taxing people more, putting more people out of work, you\\'ll never get there. You\\'ll never balance the budget by raising taxes.Spain -- Spain spends 42 percent of their total economy on government. We\\'re now spending 42 percent of our economy on government. I don\\'t want to go down the path to Spain. I want to go down the path of growth that puts Americans to work with more money coming in because they\\'re working.LEHRER: But -- but Mr. President, you\\'re saying in order to -- to get the job done, it\\'s got to be balanced. You\\'ve got to have...(CROSSTALK)OBAMA: If -- if we\\'re serious, we\\'ve got to take a balanced, responsible approach. And by the way, this is not just when it comes to individual taxes. Let\\'s talk about corporate taxes.Now, I\\'ve identified areas where we can, right away, make a change that I believe would actually help the economy.The oil industry gets $4 billion a year in corporate welfare. Basically, they get deductions that those small businesses that Governor Romney refers to, they don\\'t get.Now, does anybody think that ExxonMobil needs some extra money, when they\\'re making money every time you go to the pump? Why wouldn\\'t we want to eliminate that? Why wouldn\\'t we eliminate tax breaks for corporate jets? My attitude is, if you got a corporate jet, you can probably afford to pay full freight, not get a special break for it.When it comes to corporate taxes, Governor Romney has said he wants to, in a revenue neutral way, close loopholes, deductions -- he hasn\\'t identified which ones they are -- but that thereby bring down the corporate rate.Well, I want to do the same thing, but I\\'ve actually identified how we can do that. And part of the way to do it is to not give tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas.Right now, you can actually take a deduction for moving a plant overseas. I think most Americans would say that doesn\\'t make sense. And all that raises revenue.And so if we take a balanced approach, what that then allows us to do is also to help young people, the way we already have during my administration, make sure that they can afford to go to college.OBAMA: It means that the teacher that I met in Las Vegas, a wonderful young lady, who describes to me -- she\\'s got 42 kids in her class. The first two weeks she\\'s got them, some of them sitting on the floor until finally they get reassigned. They\\'re using text books that are 10 years old.That is not a recipe for growth. That\\'s not how America was built. And so budgets reflect choices.Ultimately, we\\'re going to have to make some decisions. And if we\\'re asking for no revenue, then that means that we\\'ve got to get rid of a whole bunch of stuff.And the magnitude of the tax cuts that you\\'re talking about, Governor, would end up resulting in severe hardship for people, but more importantly, would not help us grow.As I indicated before, when you talk about shifting Medicaid to states, we\\'re talking about potentially a 30 -- a 30 percent cut in Medicaid over time.Now, you know, that may not seem like a big deal when it just is, you know, numbers on a sheet of paper, but if we\\'re talking about a family who\\'s got an autistic kid and is depending on that Medicaid, that\\'s a big problem.And governors are creative. There\\'s no doubt about it. But they\\'re not creative enough to make up for 30 percent of revenue on something like Medicaid. What ends up happening is some people end up not getting help.ROMNEY: Jim, let\\'s -- we\\'ve gone on a lot of topics there, and so it\\'s going to take a minute to go from Medicaid to schools...LEHRER: Come back to...(CROSSTALK)ROMNEY: ... to oil, to tax breaks, then companies going overseas. So let\\'s go through them one by one.First of all, the Department of Energy has said the tax break for oil companies is $2.8 billion a year. And it\\'s actually an accounting treatment, as you know, that\\'s been in place for a hundred years. Now...OBAMA: It\\'s time to end it.ROMNEY: And in one year, you provided $90 billion in breaks to the green energy world.Now, I like green energy as well, but that\\'s about 50 years\\' worth of what oil and gas receives. And you say Exxon and Mobil. Actually, this $2.8 billion goes largely to small companies, to drilling operators and so forth.ROMNEY: But, you know, if we get that tax rate from 35 percent down to 25 percent, why that $2.8 billion is on the table. Of course it\\'s on the table. That\\'s probably not going to survive you get that rate down to 25 percent.But don\\'t forget, you put $90 billion, like 50 years\\' worth of breaks, into -- into solar and wind, to Solyndra and Fisker and Tester and Ener1. I mean, I had a friend who said you don\\'t just pick the winners and losers, you pick the losers, all right? So this -- this is not -- this is not the kind of policy you want to have if you want to get America energy secure.The second topic, which is you said you get a deduction for taking a plant overseas. Look, I\\'ve been in business for 25 years. I have no idea what you\\'re talking about. I maybe need to get a new accountant.LEHRER: Let\\'s...ROMNEY: But -- but the idea that you get a break for shipping jobs overseas is simply not the case.(CROSSTALK)ROMNEY: What we do have right now is a setting where I\\'d like to bring money from overseas back to this country.And, finally, Medicaid to states? I\\'m not quite sure where that came in, except this, which is, I would like to take the Medicaid dollars that go to states and say to a state, you\\'re going to get what you got last year, plus inflation, plus 1 percent, and then you\\'re going to manage your care for your poor in the way you think best.And I remember, as a governor, when this idea was floated by Tommy Thompson, the governors -- Republican and Democrats -- said, please let us do that. We can care for our own poor in so much better and more effective a way than having the federal government tell us how to care for our poor.So -- so let\\'s state -- one of the magnificent things about this country is the whole idea that states are the laboratories of democracy. Don\\'t have the federal government tell everybody what kind of training programs they have to have and what kind of Medicaid they have to have. Let states do this.And, by the way, if a state gets in trouble, well, we can step in and see if we can find a way to help them.LEHRER: Let\\'s go.ROMNEY: But -- but the right -- the right approach is one which relies on the brilliance of our people and states, not the federal government.LEHRER: (inaudible) and we\\'re going on -- still on the economy, on another -- but another part of it...OBAMA: OK.LEHRER: All right? All right. This is segment three, the economy. Entitlements. First -- first answer goes to you, two minutes, Mr. President. Do you see a major difference between the two of you on Social Security?OBAMA: You know, I suspect that, on Social Security, we\\'ve got a somewhat similar position. Social Security is structurally sound. It\\'s going to have to be tweaked the way it was by Ronald Reagan and Speaker -- Democratic Speaker Tip O\\'Neill. But it is -- the basic structure is sound.But -- but I want to talk about the values behind Social Security and Medicare, and then talk about Medicare, because that\\'s the big driver of our deficits right now.You know, my grandmother -- some of you know -- helped to raise me. My grandparents did. My grandfather died a while back. My grandmother died three days before I was elected president. And she was fiercely independent. She worked her way up, only had a high school education, started as a secretary, ended up being the vice president of a local bank. And she ended up living alone by choice.And the reason she could be independent was because of Social Security and Medicare. She had worked all her life, put in this money, and understood that there was a basic guarantee, a floor under which she could not go.And that\\'s the perspective I bring when I think about what\\'s called entitlements. You know, the name itself implies some sense of dependency on the part of these folks. These are folks who\\'ve worked hard, like my grandmother, and there are millions of people out there who are counting on this.OBAMA: So my approach is to say, how do we strengthen the system over the long term? And in Medicare, what we did was we said, we are going to have to bring down the costs if we\\'re going to deal with our long-term deficits, but to do that, let\\'s look where some of the money\\'s going.$716 billion we were able to save from the Medicare program by no longer overpaying insurance companies by making sure that we weren\\'t overpaying providers. And using that money, we were actually able to lower prescription drug costs for seniors by an average of $600, and we were also able to make a -- make a significant dent in providing them the kind of preventive care that will ultimately save money through the -- throughout the system.So the way for us to deal with Medicare in particular is to lower health care costs. When it comes to Social Security, as I said, you don\\'t need a major structural change in order to make sure that Social Security is there for the future.LEHRER: We\\'ll follow up on this.First, Governor Romney, you have two minutes on Social Security and entitlements.ROMNEY: Well, Jim, our seniors depend on these programs, and I know anytime we talk about entitlements, people become concerned that something\\'s going to happen that\\'s going to change their life for the worse.And the answer is neither the president nor I are proposing any changes for any current retirees or near retirees, either to Social Security or Medicare. So if you\\'re 60 or around 60 or older, you don\\'t need to listen any further.But for younger people, we need to talk about what changes are going to be occurring. Oh, I just thought about one. And that is, in fact, I was wrong when I said the president isn\\'t proposing any changes for current retirees. In fact he is on Medicare. On Social Security he\\'s not.But on Medicare, for current retirees, he\\'s cutting $716 billion from the program. Now, he says by not overpaying hospitals and providers. Actually just going to them and saying, \"We\\'re going to reduce the rates you get paid across the board, everybody\\'s going to get a lower rate.\" That\\'s not just going after places where there\\'s abuse. That\\'s saying we\\'re cutting the rates. Some 15 percent of hospitals and nursing homes say they won\\'t take anymore Medicare patients under that scenario.We also have 50 percent of doctors who say they won\\'t take more Medicare patients.This -- we have 4 million people on Medicare Advantage that will lose Medicare Advantage because of those $716 billion in cuts. I can\\'t understand how you can cut Medicare $716 billion for current recipients of Medicare.Now, you point out, well, we\\'re putting some back. We\\'re going to give a better prescription program. That\\'s $1 -- that\\'s $1 for every $15 you\\'ve cut. They\\'re smart enough to know that\\'s not a good trade.I want to take that $716 billion you\\'ve cut and put it back into Medicare. By the way, we can include a prescription program if we need to improve it.But the idea of cutting $716 billion from Medicare to be able to balance the additional cost of Obamacare is, in my opinion, a mistake.And with regards to young people coming along, I\\'ve got proposals to make sure Medicare and Social Security are there for them without any question.LEHRER: Mr. President?OBAMA: First of all, I think it\\'s important for Governor Romney to present this plan that he says will only affect folks in the future.And the essence of the plan is that you would turn Medicare into a voucher program. It\\'s called premium support, but it\\'s understood to be a voucher program. His running mate...LEHRER: And you don\\'t support that?OBAMA: I don\\'t. And let me explain why.ROMNEY: Again, that\\'s for future...OBAMA: I understand.ROMNEY: ... people, right, not for current retirees.OBAMA: For -- so if you\\'re -- if you\\'re 54 or 55, you might want to listen \\'cause this -- this will affect you.The idea, which was originally presented by Congressman Ryan, your running mate, is that we would give a voucher to seniors and they could go out in the private marketplace and buy their own health insurance.The problem is that because the voucher wouldn\\'t necessarily keep up with health care inflation, it was estimated that this would cost the average senior about $6,000 a year.Now, in fairness, what Governor Romney has now said is he\\'ll maintain traditional Medicare alongside it. But there\\'s still a problem, because what happens is, those insurance companies are pretty clever at figuring out who are the younger and healthier seniors. They recruit them, leaving the older, sicker seniors in Medicare. And every health care economist that looks at it says, over time, what\\'ll happen is the traditional Medicare system will collapse.OBAMA: And then what you\\'ve got is folks like my grandmother at the mercy of the private insurance system precisely at the time when they are most in need of decent health care.So, I don\\'t think vouchers are the right way to go. And this is not my own -- only my opinion. AARP thinks that the -- the savings that we obtained from Medicare bolster the system, lengthen the Medicare trust fund by eight years. Benefits were not affected at all. And ironically, if you repeal Obamacare, and I have become fond of this term, \"Obamacare,\" if you repeal it, what happens is those seniors right away are going to be paying $600 more in prescription care. They\\'re now going to have to be paying copays for basic checkups that can keep them healthier.And the primary beneficiary of that repeal are insurance companies that are estimated to gain billions of dollars back when they aren\\'t making seniors any healthier. And I don\\'t think that\\'s the right approach when it comes to making sure that Medicare is stronger over the long term.LEHRER: We\\'ll talk about -- specifically about health care in a moment. But what -- do you support the voucher system, Governor?ROMNEY: What I support is no change for current retirees and near-retirees to Medicare. And the president supports taking $716 billion out of that program.LEHRER: And what about the vouchers?(CROSSTALK)ROMNEY: So that\\'s -- that\\'s number one.Number two is for people coming along that are young, what I do to make sure that we can keep Medicare in place for them is to allow them either to choose the current Medicare program or a private plan. Their choice.They get to choose -- and they\\'ll have at least two plans that will be entirely at no cost to them. So they don\\'t have to pay additional money, no additional $6,000. That\\'s not going to happen. They\\'ll have at least two plans.ROMNEY: And by the way, if the government can be as efficient as the private sector and offer premiums that are as low as the private sector, people will be happy to get traditional Medicare or they\\'ll be able to get a private plan.I know my own view is I\\'d rather have a private plan. I\\'d just assume not have the government telling me what kind of health care I get. I\\'d rather be able to have an insurance company. If I don\\'t like them, I can get rid of them and find a different insurance company. But people make their own choice.The other thing we have to do to save Medicare? We have to have the benefits high for those that are low income, but for higher income people, we\\'re going to have to lower some of the benefits. We have to make sure this program is there for the long term. That\\'s the plan that I\\'ve put forward.And, by the way the idea came not even from Paul Ryan or -- or Senator Wyden, who\\'s the co-author of the bill with -- with Paul Ryan in the Senate, but also it came from Bill -- Bill Clinton\\'s chief of staff. This is an idea that\\'s been around a long time, which is saying, hey, let\\'s see if we can\\'t get competition into the Medicare world so that people can get the choice of different plans at lower cost, better quality. I believe in competition.OBAMA: Jim, if I -- if I can just respond very quickly, first of all, every study has shown that Medicare has lower administrative costs than private insurance does, which is why seniors are generally pretty happy with it.And private insurers have to make a profit. Nothing wrong with that. That\\'s what they do. And so you\\'ve got higher administrative costs, plus profit on top of that. And if you are going to save any money through what Governor Romney\\'s proposing, what has to happen is, is that the money has to come from somewhere.And when you move to a voucher system, you are putting seniors at the mercy of those insurance companies. And over time, if traditional Medicare has decayed or fallen apart, then they\\'re stuck.And this is the reason why AARP has said that your plan would weaken Medicare substantially. And that\\'s why they were supportive of the approach that we took.One last point I want to make. We do have to lower the cost of health care, not just in Medicare and Medicaid... LEHRER: Talk about that in a minute.OBAMA: ... but -- but -- but overall.LEHRER: OK.OBAMA: And so...ROMNEY: That\\'s -- that\\'s a big topic. Can we -- can we stay on Medicare?OBAMA: Is that a -- is that a separate topic?(CROSSTALK)LEHRER: Yeah, we\\'re going to -- yeah, I want to get to it.OBAMA: I\\'m sorry.LEHRER: But all I want to do is go very quickly...ROMNEY: Let\\'s get back to Medicare.LEHRER: ... before we leave the economy...ROMNEY: Let\\'s get back to Medicare.(CROSSTALK)ROMNEY: The president said that the government can provide the service at lower cost and without a profit.LEHRER: All right.ROMNEY: If that\\'s the case, then it will always be the best product that people can purchase.LEHRER: Wait a minute, Governor.ROMNEY: But my experience -- my experience the private sector typically is able to provide a better product at a lower cost.LEHRER: All right. Can we -- can the two of you agree that the voters have a choice -- a clear choice between the two...ROMNEY: Absolutely.LEHRER: ... of you on Medicare?ROMNEY: Absolutely.OBAMA: Absolutely.LEHRER: All right. So to finish quickly, briefly, on the economy, what is your view about the level of federal regulation of the economy right now? Is there too much? And in your case, Mr. President, is there -- should there be more?Beginning with you. This is not a new two-minute segment to start. And we\\'ll go for a few minutes, and then we\\'re going to go to health care, OK?ROMNEY: Regulation is essential. You can\\'t have a free market work if you don\\'t have regulation. As a businessperson, I had to have -- I need to know the regulations. I needed them there. You couldn\\'t have people opening up banks in their -- in their garage and making loans. I mean, you have to have regulations so that you can have an economy work. Every free economy has good regulation. At the same time, regulation can become excessive.LEHRER: Is it excessive now, do you think?ROMNEY: In some places, yes. Other places, no.LEHRER: Like where?(CROSSTALK)ROMNEY: No, it can become out of date. And what\\'s happened with some of the legislation that\\'s been passed during the president\\'s term, you\\'ve seen regulation become excessive, and it\\'s hurt -- it\\'s hurt the economy. Let me give you an example.Dodd-Frank was passed. And it includes within it a number of provisions that I think has some unintended consequences that are harmful to the economy. One is it designates a number of banks as too big to fail, and they\\'re effectively guaranteed by the federal government. This is the biggest kiss that\\'s been given to -- to New York banks I\\'ve ever seen. This is an enormous boon for them. There\\'ve been 122 community and small banks have closed since Dodd- Frank.So there\\'s one example. Here\\'s another. In Dodd-Frank...LEHRER: Do you want to repeal Dodd-Frank?ROMNEY: Well, I would repeal and replace it. We\\'re not going to get rid of all regulation. You have to have regulation. And there are some parts of Dodd-Frank that make all the sense in the world. You need transparency, you need to have leverage limits for...LEHRER: Well, here\\'s a specific...(CROSSTALK)ROMNEY: But let\\'s -- let\\'s mention -- let me mention the other one. Let\\'s talk...(CROSSTALK)LEHRER: No, let\\'s not. Let\\'s let him respond -- let\\'s let him respond to this specific on Dodd-Frank and what the governor just said.OBAMA: I think this is a great example. The reason we have been in such a enormous economic crisis was prompted by reckless behavior across the board.Now, it wasn\\'t just on Wall Street. You had loan officers were -- that were giving loans and mortgages that really shouldn\\'t have been given, because the folks didn\\'t qualify. You had people who were borrowing money to buy a house that they couldn\\'t afford. You had credit agencies that were stamping these as A1 great investments when they weren\\'t.But you also had banks making money hand over fist, churning out products that the bankers themselves didn\\'t even understand, in order to make big profits, but knowing that it made the entire system vulnerable.So what did we do? We stepped in and had the toughest reforms on Wall Street since the 1930s. We said you\\'ve got -- banks, you\\'ve got to raise your capital requirements. You can\\'t engage in some of this risky behavior that is putting Main Street at risk. We\\'ve going to make sure that you\\'ve got to have a living will so -- so we can know how you\\'re going to wind things down if you make a bad bet so we don\\'t have other taxpayer bailouts.OBAMA: In the meantime, by the way, we also made sure that all the help that we provided those banks was paid back every single dime, with interest.Now, Governor Romney has said he wants to repeal Dodd-Frank.And, you know, I appreciate and it appears we\\'ve got some agreement that a marketplace to work has to have some regulation. But in the past, Governor Romney has said he just want to repeal Dodd- Frank, roll it back.And so the question is: Does anybody out there think that the big problem we had is that there was too much oversight and regulation of Wall Street? Because if you do, then Governor Romney is your candidate. But that\\'s not what I believe.ROMNEY: Sorry, but that\\'s just not -- that\\'s just not the facts. Look, we have to have regulation on Wall Street. That\\'s why I\\'d have regulation. But I wouldn\\'t designate five banks as too big to fail and give them a blank check. That\\'s one of the unintended consequences of Dodd-Frank. It wasn\\'t thought through properly. We need to get rid of that provision because it\\'s killing regional and small banks. They\\'re getting hurt.Let me mention another regulation in Dodd-Frank. You say we were giving mortgages to people who weren\\'t qualified. That\\'s exactly right. It\\'s one of the reasons for the great financial calamity we had. And so Dodd-Frank correctly says we need to have qualified mortgages, and if you give a mortgage that\\'s not qualified, there are big penalties, except they didn\\'t ever go on and define what a qualified mortgage was.It\\'s been two years. We don\\'t know what a qualified mortgage is yet. So banks are reluctant to make loans, mortgages. Try and get a mortgage these days. It\\'s hurt the housing market because Dodd-Frank didn\\'t anticipate putting in place the kinds of regulations you have to have. It\\'s not that Dodd-Frank always was wrong with too much regulation. Sometimes they didn\\'t come out with a clear regulation.I will make sure we don\\'t hurt the functioning of our -- of our marketplace and our business, because I want to bring back housing and get good jobs.LEHRER: All right. I think we have another clear difference between the two of you. Now, let\\'s move to health care where I know there is a clear difference, and that has to do with the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare. And it\\'s a two-minute new -- new segment, and that means two minutes each. And you go first, Governor Romney.LEHRER: You want it repealed. You want the Affordable Care Act repealed. Why?ROMNEY: I sure do. Well, in part, it comes, again, from my experience. You know, I was in New Hampshire. A woman came to me and she said, look, I can\\'t afford insurance for myself or my son. I met a couple in Appleton, Wisconsin, and they said, we\\'re thinking of dropping our insurance, we can\\'t afford it.And the number of small businesses I\\'ve gone to that are saying they\\'re dropping insurance because they can\\'t afford it, the cost of health care is just prohibitive. And -- and we\\'ve got to deal with cost.And, unfortunately, when -- when -- when you look at Obamacare, the Congressional Budget Office has said it will cost $2,500 a year more than traditional insurance. So it\\'s adding to cost. And as a matter of fact, when the president ran for office, he said that, by this year, he would have brought down the cost of insurance for each family by $2,500 a family. Instead, it\\'s gone up by that amount. So it\\'s expensive. Expensive things hurt families. So that\\'s one reason I don\\'t want it.Second reason, it cuts $716 billion from Medicare to pay for it. I want to put that money back in Medicare for our seniors.Number three, it puts in place an unelected board that\\'s going to tell people ultimately what kind of treatments they can have. I don\\'t like that idea.Fourth, there was a survey done of small businesses across the country, said, what\\'s been the effect of Obamacare on your hiring plans? And three-quarters of them said it makes us less likely to hire people. I just don\\'t know how the president could have come into office, facing 23 million people out of work, rising unemployment, an economic crisis at the -- at the kitchen table, and spend his energy and passion for two years fighting for Obamacare instead of fighting for jobs for the American people. It has killed jobs.And the best course for health care is to do what we did in my state: craft a plan at the state level that fits the needs of the state. And then let\\'s focus on getting the costs down for people, rather than raising it with the $2,500 additional premium.LEHRER: Mr. President, the argument against repeal? OBAMA: Well, four years ago, when I was running for office, I was traveling around and having those same conversations that Governor Romney talks about. And it wasn\\'t just that small businesses were seeing costs skyrocket and they couldn\\'t get affordable coverage even if they wanted to provide it to their employees. It wasn\\'t just that this was the biggest driver of our federal deficit, our overall health care costs, but it was families who were worried about going bankrupt if they got sick, millions of families, all across the country.If they had a pre-existing condition, they might not be able to get coverage at all. If they did have coverage, insurance companies might impose an arbitrary limit. And so as a consequence, they\\'re paying their premiums, somebody gets really sick, lo and behold, they don\\'t have enough money to pay the bills, because the insurance companies say that they\\'ve hit the limit.So we did work on this, alongside working on jobs, because this is part of making sure that middle-class families are secure in this country.And let me tell you exactly what Obamacare did. Number one, if you\\'ve got health insurance, it doesn\\'t mean a government takeover. You keep your own insurance. You keep your own doctor. But it does say insurance companies can\\'t jerk you around. They can\\'t impose arbitrary lifetime limits. They have to let you keep your kid on their insurance -- your insurance plan until you\\'re 26 years old. And it also says that you\\'re going to have to get rebates if insurance companies are spending more on administrative costs and profits than they are on actual care.Number two, if you don\\'t have health insurance, we\\'re essentially setting up a group plan that allows you to benefit from group rates that are typically 18 percent lower than if you\\'re out there trying to get insurance on the individual market.Now, the last point I\\'d make before...LEHRER: Two minutes -- two minutes is up, sir.OBAMA: No, I think -- I had five seconds before you interrupted me, was ...(LAUGHTER)... the irony is that we\\'ve seen this model work really well in Massachusetts, because Governor Romney did a good thing, working with Democrats in the state to set up what is essentially the identical model and as a consequence people are covered there. It hasn\\'t destroyed jobs. And as a consequence, we now have a system in which we have the opportunity to start bringing down costs, as opposed to just leaving millions of people out in the cold.LEHRER: Your five seconds went away a long time ago.All right, Governor. Governor, tell -- tell the president directly why you think what he just said is wrong about Obamacare?ROMNEY: Well, I did with my first statement.(CROSSTALK)ROMNEY: First of all, I like the way we did it in Massachusetts. I like the fact that in my state, we had Republicans and Democrats come together and work together. What you did instead was to push through a plan without a single Republican vote. As a matter of fact, when Massachusetts did something quite extraordinary -- elected a Republican senator to stop Obamacare, you pushed it through anyway.So entirely on a partisan basis, instead of bringing America together and having a discussion on this important topic, you pushed through something that you and Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid thought was the best answer and drove it through.What we did in a legislature 87 percent Democrat, we worked together; 200 legislators in my legislature, only two voted against the plan by the time we were finished. What were some differences? We didn\\'t raise taxes. You\\'ve raised them by $1 trillion under Obamacare. We didn\\'t cut Medicare. Of course, we don\\'t have Medicare, but we didn\\'t cut Medicare by $716 billion.ROMNEY: We didn\\'t put in place a board that can tell people ultimately what treatments they\\'re going to receive. We didn\\'t also do something that I think a number of people across this country recognize, which is put -- put people in a position where they\\'re going to lose the insurance they had and they wanted.Right now, the CBO says up to 20 million people will lose their insurance as Obamacare goes into effect next year. And likewise, a study by McKinsey and Company of American businesses said 30 percent of them are anticipating dropping people from coverage.So for those reasons, for the tax, for Medicare, for this board, and for people losing their insurance, this is why the American people don\\'t want Medicare -- don\\'t want Obamacare. It\\'s why Republicans said, do not do this, and the Republicans had -- had the plan. They put a plan out. They put out a plan, a bipartisan plan. It was swept aside.I think something this big, this important has to be done on a bipartisan basis. And we have to have a president who can reach across the aisle and fashion important legislation with the input from both parties.OBAMA: Governor Romney said this has to be done on a bipartisan basis. This was a bipartisan idea. In fact, it was a Republican idea. And Governor Romney at the beginning of this debate wrote and said what we did in Massachusetts could be a model for the nation.And I agree that the Democratic legislators in Massachusetts might have given some advice to Republicans in Congress about how to cooperate, but the fact of the matter is, we used the same advisers, and they say it\\'s the same plan.It -- when Governor Romney talks about this board, for example, unelected board that we\\'ve created, what this is, is a group of health care experts, doctors, et cetera, to figure out, how can we reduce the cost of care in the system overall?Because there -- there are two ways of dealing with our health care crisis. One is to simply leave a whole bunch of people uninsured and let them fend for themselves, to let businesses figure out how long they can continue to pay premiums until finally they just give up, and their workers are no longer getting insured, and that\\'s been the trend line.Or, alternatively, we can figure out, how do we make the cost of care more effective? And there are ways of doing it.So at Cleveland Clinic, one of the best health care systems in the world, they actually provide great care cheaper than average. And the reason they do is because they do some smart things. They -- they say, if a patient\\'s coming in, let\\'s get all the doctors together at once, do one test instead of having the patient run around with 10 tests. Let\\'s make sure that we\\'re providing preventive care so we\\'re catching the onset of something like diabetes. Let\\'s -- let\\'s pay providers on the basis of performance as opposed to on the basis of how many procedures they\\'ve -- they\\'ve engaged in.Now, so what this board does is basically identifies best practices and says, let\\'s use the purchasing power of Medicare and Medicaid to help to institutionalize all these good things that we do.And the fact of the matter is that, when Obamacare is fully implemented, we\\'re going to be in a position to show that costs are going down. And over the last two years, health care premiums have gone up -- it\\'s true -- but they\\'ve gone up slower than any time in the last 50 years. So we\\'re already beginning to see progress. In the meantime, folks out there with insurance, you\\'re already getting a rebate.Let me make one last point. Governor Romney says, we should replace it, I\\'m just going to repeal it, but -- but we can replace it with something. But the problem is, he hasn\\'t described what exactly we\\'d replace it with, other than saying we\\'re going to leave it to the states.OBAMA: But the fact of the matter is that some of the prescriptions that he\\'s offered, like letting you buy insurance across state lines, there\\'s no indication that that somehow is going to help somebody who\\'s got a pre-existing condition be able to finally buy insurance. In fact, it\\'s estimated that by repealing Obamacare, you\\'re looking at 50 million people losing health insurance...LEHRER: Let\\'s...OBAMA: ... at a time when it\\'s vitally important.LEHRER: Let\\'s let the governor explain what you would do...ROMNEY: Well...LEHRER: ... if Obamacare is repealed. How would you replace it?(CROSSTALK)ROMNEY: Well, actually it\\'s -- it\\'s -- it\\'s a lengthy description. But, number one, preexisting conditions are covered under my plan. Number two, young people are able to stay on their family plan. That\\'s already offered in the private marketplace. You don\\'t have to have the government mandate that for that to occur.But let\\'s come back to something the president and I agree on, which is the key task we have in health care is to get the cost down so it\\'s more affordable for families. And then he has as a model for doing that a board of people at the government, an unelected board, appointed board, who are going to decide what kind of treatment you ought to have.(CROSSTALK)ROMNEY: In my opinion, the government is not effective in -- in bringing down the cost of almost anything. As a matter of fact, free people and free enterprises trying to find ways to do things better are able to be more effective in bringing down the cost than the government will ever be.Your example of the Cleveland Clinic is my case in point, along with several others I could describe.This is the private market. These are small -- these are enterprises competing with each other, learning how to do better and better jobs. I used to consult to businesses -- excuse me, to hospitals and to health care providers. I was astonished at the creativity and innovation that exists in the American people.In order to bring the cost of health care down, we don\\'t need to have a board of 15 people telling us what kinds of treatments we should have. We instead need to put insurance plans, providers, hospitals, doctors on target such that they have an incentive, as you say, performance pay, for doing an excellent job, for keeping costs down, and that\\'s happening. Innermountain Healthcare does it superbly well, Mayo Clinic is doing it superbly well, Cleveland Clinic, others.ROMNEY: But the right answer is not to have the federal government take over health care and start mandating to the providers across America, telling a patient and a doctor what kind of treatment they can have.That\\'s the wrong way to go. The private market and individual responsibility always work best.OBAMA: Let me just point out first of all this board that we\\'re talking about can\\'t make decisions about what treatments are given. That\\'s explicitly prohibited in the law. But let\\'s go back to what Governor Romney indicated, that under his plan, he would be able to cover people with preexisting conditions.Well, actually Governor, that isn\\'t what your plan does. What your plan does is to duplicate what\\'s already the law, which says if you are out of health insurance for three months, then you can end up getting continuous coverage and an insurance company can\\'t deny you if you\\'ve -- if it\\'s been under 90 days.But that\\'s already the law and that doesn\\'t help the millions of people out there with preexisting conditions. There\\'s a reason why Governor Romney set up the plan that he did in Massachusetts. It wasn\\'t a government takeover of health care. It was the largest expansion of private insurance. But what it does say is that \"insurers, you\\'ve got to take everybody.\"Now, that also means that you\\'ve got more customers. But when -- when Governor Romney says that he\\'ll replace it with something, but can\\'t detail how it will be in fact replaced and the reason he set up the system he did in Massachusetts was because there isn\\'t a better way of dealing with the preexisting conditions problem.OBAMA: It just reminds me of, you know, he says that he\\'s going to close deductions and loopholes for his tax plan. That\\'s how it\\'s going to be paid for, but we don\\'t know the details. He says that he\\'s going to replace Dodd-Frank, Wall Street reform, but we don\\'t know exactly which ones. He won\\'t tell us. He now says he\\'s going to replace Obamacare and ensure that all the good things that are in it are going to be in there and you don\\'t have to worry.And at some point, I think the American people have to ask themselves, is the reason that Governor Romney is keeping all these plans to replace secret because they\\'re too good? Is it -- is it because that somehow middle-class families are going to benefit too much from them?No. The reason is, is because, when we reform Wall Street, when we tackle the problem of pre-existing conditions, then, you know, these are tough problems and we\\'ve got to make choices. And the choices we\\'ve made have been ones that ultimately are benefiting middle-class families all across the country.LEHRER: We\\'re going to move to...ROMNEY: No. I -- I have to respond to that.LEHRER: No, but...ROMNEY: Which is -- which is my experience as a governor is if I come in and -- and lay down a piece of legislation and say, \"It\\'s my way or the highway,\" I don\\'t get a lot done. What I do is the same way that Tip O\\'Neill and Ronald Reagan worked together some years ago. When Ronald Reagan ran for office, he laid out the principles that he was going to foster. He said he was going to lower tax rates. He said he was going to broaden the base. You\\'ve said the same thing, you\\'re going to simplify the tax code, broaden the base.Those are my principles. I want to bring down the tax burden on middle-income families. And I\\'m going to work together with Congress to say, OK, what -- what are the various ways we could bring down deductions, for instance? One way, for instance, would be to have a single number. Make up a number, $25,000, $50,000. Anybody can have deductions up to that amount. And then that number disappears for high-income people. That\\'s one way one could do it. One could follow Bowles-Simpson as a model and take deduction by deduction and make differences that way. There are alternatives to accomplish the objective I have, which is to bring down rates, broaden the base, simplify the code, and create incentives for growth. And with regards to health care, you had remarkable details with regards to my pre-existing condition plan. You obviously studied up on -- on my plan. In fact, I do have a plan that deals with people with pre-existing conditions. That\\'s part of my health care plan. And what we did in Massachusetts is a model for the nation state by state. And I said that at that time.The federal government taking over health care for the entire nation and whisking aside the 10th Amendment, which gives states the rights for these kinds of things, is not the course for America to have a stronger, more vibrant economy.LEHRER: That is a terrific segue to our next segment, and is the role of government. And -- and let\\'s see. Role of government. And it is -- you are first on this, Mr. President. And the question is this. Do you believe, both of you -- but you had the first two minutes on this, Mr. President -- do you believe there\\'s a fundamental difference between the two of you as to how you view the mission of the federal government?OBAMA: Well, I definitely think there are differences.LEHRER: And do you -- yeah.OBAMA: The first role of the federal government is to keep the American people safe. That\\'s its most basic function. And as commander-in-chief, that is something that I\\'ve worked on and thought about every single day that I\\'ve been in the Oval Office.But I also believe that government has the capacity, the federal government has the capacity to help open up opportunity and create ladders of opportunity and to create frameworks where the American people can succeed.Look, the genius of America is the free enterprise system and freedom and the fact that people can go out there and start a business, work on an idea, make their own decisions.OBAMA: But as Abraham Lincoln understood, there are also some things we do better together. So, in the middle of the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln said, let\\'s help to finance the Transcontinental Railroad, let\\'s start the National Academy of Sciences, let\\'s start land grant colleges, because we want to give these gateways of opportunity for all Americans, because if all Americans are getting opportunity, we\\'re all going to be better off. That doesn\\'t restrict people\\'s freedom. That enhances it.And so what I\\'ve tried to do as president is to apply those same principles.And when it comes to education what I\\'ve said is we\\'ve got to reform schools that are not working. We use something called Race to the Top. Wasn\\'t a top-down approach, Governor. What we\\'ve said is to states, we\\'ll give you more money if you initiate reforms. And as a consequence, you had 46 states around the country who have made a real difference.But what I\\'ve also said is let\\'s hire another 100,000 math and science teachers to make sure we maintain our technological lead and our people are skilled and able to succeed. And hard-pressed states right now can\\'t all do that. In fact we\\'ve seen layoffs of hundreds of thousands of teachers over the last several years, and Governor Romney doesn\\'t think we need more teachers. I do, because I think that that is the kind of investment where the federal government can help.It can\\'t do it all, but it can make a difference. And as a consequence we\\'ll have a better trained workforce and that will create jobs because companies want to locate in places where we\\'ve got a skilled workforce.LEHRER: Two minutes, Governor, on the role of government. Your view?ROMNEY: Well, first, I love great schools. Massachusetts, our schools are ranked number one of all 50 states. And the key to great schools, great teachers.So I reject the idea that I don\\'t believe in great teachers or more teachers. Every school district, every state should make that decision on their own.The role of government: Look behind us. The Constitution and the Declaration of Independence. The role of government is to promote and protect the principles of those documents.ROMNEY: First, life and liberty. We have a responsibility to protect the lives and liberties of our people, and that means a military second to none. I do not believe in cutting our military. I believe in maintaining the strength of America\\'s military.Second, in that line that says we are endowed by our creator with our rights, I believe we must maintain our commitment to religious tolerance and freedom in this country. That statement also says that we are endowed by our creator with the right to pursue happiness as we choose. I interpret that as, one, making sure that those people who are less fortunate and can\\'t care for themselves are cared by -- by one another.We\\'re a nation that believes that we\\'re all children of the same god and we care for those that have difficulties, those that are elderly and have problems and challenges, those that are disabled. We care for them. And we -- we look for discovery and innovation, all these things desired out of the American heart to provide the pursuit of happiness for our citizens.But we also believe in maintaining for individuals the right to pursue their dreams and not to have the government substitute itself for the rights of free individuals. And what we\\'re seeing right now is, in my view, a -- a trickle-down government approach, which has government thinking it can do a better job than free people pursuing their dreams. And it\\'s not working.And the proof of that is 23 million people out of work. The proof of that is 1 out of 6 people in poverty. The proof of that is we\\'ve gone from 32 million on food stamps to 47 million on food stamps. The proof of that is that 50 percent of college graduates this year can\\'t find work.LEHRER: All right.ROMNEY: We know that the path we\\'re taking is not working. It\\'s time for a new path.LEHRER: All right. Let\\'s go through some specifics in terms of what -- how each of you views the role of government. How do -- education. Does the federal government have a responsibility to improve the quality of public education in America?ROMNEY: Well, the primary responsibility for education is -- is, of course, at the state and local level. But the federal government also can play a very important role. And I -- and I agree with Secretary Arne Duncan, he\\'s -- some ideas he\\'s put forward on Race to the Top, not all of them, but some of them I agree with and -- and congratulate him for pursuing that. The federal government can get local and -- and state schools to do a better job.My own view, by the way, is I\\'ve added to that. I happen to believe, I want the kids that are getting federal dollars from IDEA or Title I -- these are disabled kids or -- or -- or poor kids or -- or lower-income kids, rather, I want them to be able to go to the school of their choice.So all federal funds, instead of going to the -- to the state or to the school district, I\\'d have go, if you will, follow the child and let the parent and the child decide where to send their -- their -- their student.LEHRER: How do you see the federal government\\'s responsibility to, as I say, to improve the quality of public education in this country?OBAMA: Well, as I\\'ve indicated, I think that it has a significant role to play. Through our Race to the Top program, we\\'ve worked with Republican and Democratic governors to initiate major reforms, and they\\'re having an impact right now.LEHRER: Do you think you have a difference with your views and -- and those of Governor Romney on -- about education and the federal government?OBAMA: You know, this is where budgets matter, because budgets reflect choices. So when Governor Romney indicates that he wants to cut taxes and potentially benefit folks like me and him, and to pay for it we\\'re having to initiate significant cuts in federal support for education, that makes a difference.You know, his -- his running mate, Congressman Ryan, put forward a budget that reflects many of the principles that Governor Romney\\'s talked about. And it wasn\\'t very detailed. This seems to be a trend. But -- but what it did do is to -- if you extrapolated how much money we\\'re talking about, you\\'d look at cutting the education budget by up to 20 percent.OBAMA: When it comes to community colleges, we are seeing great work done out there all over the country because we have the opportunity to train people for jobs that exist right now. And one of the things I suspect Governor Romney and I probably agree on is getting businesses to work with community colleges so that they\\'re setting up their training programs...LEHRER: Do you -- do you agree, Governor?OBAMA: Let me just finish the point.(CROSSTALK)OBAMA: The -- where they\\'re partnering so that they\\'re designing training programs. And people who are going through them know that there\\'s a job waiting for them if they complete it. That makes a big difference, but that requires some federal support.Let me just say one final example. When it comes to making college affordable, whether it\\'s two-year or four-year, one of the things that I did as president was we were sending $60 billion to banks and lenders as middlemen for the student loan program, even though the loans were guaranteed. So there was no risk for the banks or the lenders, but they were taking billions out of the system.And we said, \"Why not cut out the middleman?\" And as a consequence, what we\\'ve been able to do is to provide millions more students assistance, lower or keep low interest rates on student loans. And this is an example of where our priorities make a difference.Governor Romney, I genuinely believe cares about education, but when he tells a student that, you know, \"you should borrow money from your parents to go to college,\" you know, that indicates the degree to which, you know, there may not be as much of a focus on the fact that folks like myself, folks like Michelle, kids probably who attend University of Denver, just don\\'t have that option.And for us to be able to make sure that they\\'ve got that opportunity and they can walk through that door, that is vitally important not just to those kids. It\\'s how we\\'re going to grow this economy over the long term.LEHRER: We\\'re running out of time, gentlemen.(CROSSTALK) LEHRER: Governor?ROMNEY: Mr. President, Mr. President, you\\'re entitled as the president to your own airplane and to your own house, but not to your own facts. All right, I\\'m not going to cut education funding. I don\\'t have any plan to cut education funding and -- and grants that go to people going to college. I\\'m planning on (inaudible) to grow. So I\\'m not planning on making changes there.But you make a very good point, which is that the place you put your money just makes a pretty clear indication of where your heart is. You put $90 billion into -- into green jobs. And I -- look, I\\'m all in favor of green energy. $90 billion, that would have -- that would have hired 2 million teachers. $90 billion.And these businesses, many of them have gone out of business, I think about half of them, of the ones have been invested in have gone out of business. A number of them happened to be owned by people who were contributors to your campaigns.Look, the right course for America\\'s government, we were talking about the role of government, is not to become the economic player, picking winners and losers, telling people what kind of health treatment they can receive, taking over the health care system that has existed in this country for a long, long time and has produced the best health records in the world.The right answer for government is say, How do we make the private sector become more efficient and more effective? How do we get schools to be more competitive? Let\\'s grade them. I propose we grade our schools so parents know which schools are succeeding and failing, so they can take their child to a -- to a school that he\\'s being more successful.I don\\'t want to cut our commitment to education. I wanted to make it more effective and efficient. And by the way, I\\'ve had that experience. I don\\'t just talk about it. I\\'ve been there. Massachusetts schools are ranked number one in the nation. This is not because I didn\\'t have commitment to education. It\\'s because I care about education for all of our kids.LEHRER: All right, gentlemen...(CROSSTALK)LEHRER: Excuse me (inaudible). Excuse me, sir. We\\'ve got -- we\\'ve got -- barely have three minutes left. I\\'m not going to grade the two of you and say your answers have been too long or I\\'ve done a poor job.OBAMA: You\\'ve done a great job.LEHRER: Oh, well, no. But the fact is government -- the role of government and governing, we\\'ve lost a pod in other words. So we only have three -- three minutes left in the -- in the debate before we go to your closing statements. And so I want to ask finally here, and remember, we\\'ve got three minutes total time here -- and the question is this. Many of the legislative functions of the federal government right now are in a state of paralysis as a result of partisan gridlock. If elected, in your case, if re-elected, in your case, what would you do about that?Governor?ROMNEY: Jim, I had the great experience -- it didn\\'t seem like it at the time -- of being elected in a state where my legislature was 87 percent Democrat. And that meant I figured out from day one I had to get along and I had to work across the aisle to get anything done. We drove our schools to be number one in the nation. We cut taxes 19 times.LEHRER: But what would you do as president?ROMNEY: We -- as president, I will sit on day one -- actually, the day after I get elected -- I\\'ll sit down with leaders -- the Democratic leaders, as well as Republican leaders, and continue -- as we did in my state -- we met every Monday for a couple hours, talked about the issues and the challenges in the -- in the -- in our state in that case. We have to work on a collaborative basis, not because we\\'re going to compromise our principle, but because there\\'s common ground.And the challenges America faces right now -- look, the reason I\\'m in this race is there are people that are really hurting today in this country. And we face -- this deficit could crush the future generations. What\\'s happening in the Middle East, there are developments around the world that are of real concern.LEHRER: All right.ROMNEY: And Republicans and Democrats both love America. But we need to have leadership -- leadership in Washington that will actually bring people together and get the job done and could not care less if -- if it\\'s a Republican or a Democrat. I\\'ve done it before. I\\'ll do it again.LEHRER: Mr. President?OBAMA: Well, first of all, I think Governor Romney\\'s going to have a busy first day, because he\\'s also going to repeal Obamacare, which will not be very popular among Democrats as you\\'re sitting down with them.(LAUGHTER)But, look, my philosophy has been, I will take ideas from anybody, Democrat or Republican, as long as they\\'re advancing the cause of making middle-class families stronger and giving ladders of opportunity to the middle class. That\\'s how we cut taxes for middle- class families and small businesses. That\\'s how we cut a trillion dollars of spending that wasn\\'t advancing that cause. That\\'s how we signed three trade deals into law that are helping us to double our exports and sell more American products around the world. That\\'s how we repealed \"don\\'t ask/don\\'t tell.\" That\\'s how we ended the war in Iraq, as I promised, and that\\'s how we\\'re going to wind down the war in Afghanistan. That\\'s how we went after Al Qaida and bin Laden.So we\\'ve -- we\\'ve seen progress even under Republican control of the House of Representatives. But, ultimately, part of being principled, part of being a leader is, A, being able to describe exactly what it is that you intend to do, not just saying, \"I\\'ll sit down,\" but you have to have a plan.Number two, what\\'s important is occasionally you\\'ve got to say no, to -- to -- to folks both in your own party and in the other party. And, you know, yes, have we had some fights between me and the Republicans when -- when they fought back against us reining in the excesses of Wall Street? Absolutely, because that was a fight that needed to be had.When -- when we were fighting about whether or not we were going to make sure that Americans had more security with their health insurance and they said no, yes, that was a fight that we needed to have.LEHRER: All rightOBAMA: And so part of leadership and governing is both saying what it is that you are for, but also being willing to say no to some things. And I\\'ve got to tell you, Governor Romney, when it comes to his own party during the course of this campaign, has not displayed that willingness to say no to some of the more extreme parts of his party.LEHRER: That brings us to closing statements. It was a coin toss. Governor Romney, you won the toss and you elected to go last, so you have a closing two minutes, Mr. President.OBAMA: Well, Jim, I want to thank you, and I want to thank Governor Romney, because I think was a terrific debate, and I very much appreciate it. And I want to thank the University of Denver.You know, four years ago, we were going through a major crisis. And yet my faith and confidence in the American future is undiminished. And the reason is because of its people, because of the woman I met in North Carolina who decided at 55 to go back to school because she wanted to inspire her daughter and now has a job from that new training that she\\'s gotten; because a company in Minnesota who was willing to give up salaries and perks for their executives to make sure that they didn\\'t lay off workers during a recession.The auto workers that you meet in Toledo or Detroit take such pride in building the best cars in the world, not just because of a paycheck, but because it gives them that sense of pride, that they\\'re helping to build America. And so the question now is how do we build on those strengths. And everything that I\\'ve tried to do, and everything that I\\'m now proposing for the next four years in terms of improving our education system or developing American energy or making sure that we\\'re closing loopholes for companies that are shipping jobs overseas and focusing on small businesses and companies that are creating jobs here in the United States, or closing our deficit in a responsible, balanced way that allows us to invest in our future.All those things are designed to make sure that the American people, their genius, their grit, their determination, is -- is channeled and -- and they have an opportunity to succeed. And everybody\\'s getting a fair shot. And everybody\\'s getting a fair share -- everybody\\'s doing a fair share, and everybody\\'s playing by the same rules.You know, four years ago, I said that I\\'m not a perfect man and I wouldn\\'t be a perfect president. And that\\'s probably a promise that Governor Romney thinks I\\'ve kept. But I also promised that I\\'d fight every single day on behalf of the American people, the middle class, and all those who were striving to get into the middle class. I\\'ve kept that promise and if you\\'ll vote for me, then I promise I\\'ll fight just as hard in a second term.LEHRER: Governor Romney, your two-minute closing.ROMNEY: Thank you, Jim, and Mr. President. And thank you for tuning in this evening.This is a -- this is an important election and I\\'m concerned about America. I\\'m concerned about the direction America has been taking over the last four years.I -- I know this is bigger than an election about the two of us as individuals. It\\'s bigger than our respective parties. It\\'s an election about the course of America. What kind of America do you want to have for yourself and for your children.And there really are two very different paths that we began speaking about this evening, and over the course of this month we\\'re going to have two more presidential debates and a vice presidential debate. We\\'re talk about those two paths.But they lead in very different directions. And it\\'s not just looking to our words that you have to take in evidence of where they go. You can look at the record.There\\'s no question in my mind that if the president were to be reelected you\\'ll continue to see a middle-class squeeze with incomes going down and prices going up.I\\'ll get incomes up again.You\\'ll see chronic unemployment. We\\'ve had 43 straight months with unemployment above 8 percent.If I\\'m president I will create -- help create 12 million new jobs in this country with rising incomes.If the president\\'s reelected, Obamacare will be fully installed. In my view that\\'s going to mean a whole different way of life for people who counted on the insurance plan they had in the past. Many will lose it. You\\'re going to see health premiums go up by some $2,500 per family.If I\\'m elected we won\\'t have Obama. We\\'ll put in place the kind of principles that I put in place in my own state and allow each state to craft their own programs to get people insured and we\\'ll focus on getting the cost of health care down.If the president were to be reelected you\\'re going to see a $716 billion cut to Medicare. You\\'ll have 4 million people who will lose Medicare Advantage. You\\'ll have hospital and providers that\\'ll no longer accept Medicare patients.I\\'ll restore that $716 billion to Medicare.And finally, military. The president\\'s reelected you\\'ll see dramatic cuts to our military. The secretary of defense has said these would be even devastating.I will not cut our commitment to our military. I will keep America strong and get America\\'s middle class working again.Thank you, Jim.LEHRER: Thank you, Governor.Thank you, Mr. President.The next debate will be the vice presidential event on Thursday, October 11th at Centre College in Danville, Kentucky. For now, from the University of Denver, I\\'m Jim Lehrer. Thank you, and good night.Â\\xa0',\n",
       " 'September 26, 2008 Debate TranscriptSeptember 26, 2008The First McCain-Obama Presidential DebateFIRST PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES\\' DEBATETHE UNIVERSITY OF MISSISSIPPI, OXFORD MISSISSIPPISPEAKERS:U.S. SENATOR JOHN MCCAIN (AZ)REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEEU. S. SENATOR BARACK OBAMA (IL)DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEEJIM LEHREREXECUTIVE EDITOR AND ANCHOR, THE NEWSHOUR, PBS[*] LEHRER: Good evening from the Ford Center for the Performing Arts at the University of Mississippi in Oxford. I\\'m Jim Lehrer of the NewsHour on PBS, and I welcome you to the first of the 2008 presidential debates between the Republican nominee, Senator John McCain of Arizona, and the Democratic nominee, Senator Barack Obama of Illinois.The Commission on Presidential Debates is the sponsor of this event and the three other presidential and vice presidential debates coming in October.Tonight\\'s will primarily be about foreign policy and national security, which, by definition, includes the global financial crisis. It will be divided roughly into nine-minute segments.Direct exchanges between the candidates and moderator follow-ups are permitted after each candidate has two minutes to answer the lead question in an order determined by a coin toss.The specific subjects and questions were chosen by me. They have not been shared or cleared with anyone.The audience here in the hall has promised to remain silent, no cheers, no applause, no noise of any kind, except right now, as we welcome Senators Obama and McCain.(APPLAUSE)Let me begin with something General Eisenhower said in his 1952 presidential campaign. Quote, \"We must achieve both security and solvency. In fact, the foundation of military strength is economic strength,\" end quote.With that in mind, the first lead question.Gentlemen, at this very moment tonight, where do you stand on the financial recovery plan?First response to you, Senator Obama. You have two minutes.OBAMA: Well, thank you very much, Jim, and thanks to the commission and the University of Mississippi, Ole Miss, for hosting us tonight. I can\\'t think of a more important time for us to talk about the future of the country.You know, we are at a defining moment in our history. Our nation is involved in two wars, and we are going through the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.And although we\\'ve heard a lot about Wall Street, those of you on Main Street I think have been struggling for a while, and you recognize that this could have an impact on all sectors of the economy.And you\\'re wondering, how\\'s it going to affect me? How\\'s it going to affect my job? How\\'s it going to affect my house? How\\'s it going to affect my retirement savings or my ability to send my children to college?So we have to move swiftly, and we have to move wisely. And I\\'ve put forward a series of proposals that make sure that we protect taxpayers as we engage in this important rescue effort.Number one, we\\'ve got to make sure that we\\'ve got oversight over this whole process; $700 billion, potentially, is a lot of money.Number two, we\\'ve got to make sure that taxpayers, when they are putting their money at risk, have the possibility of getting that money back and gains, if the market -- and when the market returns.Number three, we\\'ve got to make sure that none of that money is going to pad CEO bank accounts or to promote golden parachutes.And, number four, we\\'ve got to make sure that we\\'re helping homeowners, because the root problem here has to do with the foreclosures that are taking place all across the country.Now, we also have to recognize that this is a final verdict on eight years of failed economic policies promoted by George Bush, supported by Senator McCain, a theory that basically says that we can shred regulations and consumer protections and give more and more to the most, and somehow prosperity will trickle down.It hasn\\'t worked. And I think that the fundamentals of the economy have to be measured by whether or not the middle class is getting a fair shake. That\\'s why I\\'m running for president, and that\\'s what I hope we\\'re going to be talking about tonight.LEHRER: Senator McCain, two minutes.MCCAIN: Well, thank you, Jim. And thanks to everybody.And I do have a sad note tonight. Senator Kennedy is in the hospital. He\\'s a dear and beloved friend to all of us. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the lion of the Senate.I also want to thank the University of Mississippi for hosting us tonight.And, Jim, I -- I\\'ve been not feeling too great about a lot of things lately. So have a lot of Americans who are facing challenges. But I\\'m feeling a little better tonight, and I\\'ll tell you why.Because as we\\'re here tonight in this debate, we are seeing, for the first time in a long time, Republicans and Democrats together, sitting down, trying to work out a solution to this fiscal crisis that we\\'re in.And have no doubt about the magnitude of this crisis. And we\\'re not talking about failure of institutions on Wall Street. We\\'re talking about failures on Main Street, and people who will lose their jobs, and their credits, and their homes, if we don\\'t fix the greatest fiscal crisis, probably in -- certainly in our time, and I\\'ve been around a little while.But the point is -- the point is, we have finally seen Republicans and Democrats sitting down and negotiating together and coming up with a package.This package has transparency in it. It has to have accountability and oversight. It has to have options for loans to failing businesses, rather than the government taking over those loans. We have to -- it has to have a package with a number of other essential elements to it.And, yes, I went back to Washington, and I met with my Republicans in the House of Representatives. And they weren\\'t part of the negotiations, and I understand that. And it was the House Republicans that decided that they would be part of the solution to this problem.But I want to emphasize one point to all Americans tonight. This isn\\'t the beginning of the end of this crisis. This is the end of the beginning, if we come out with a package that will keep these institutions stable.And we\\'ve got a lot of work to do. And we\\'ve got to create jobs. And one of the areas, of course, is to eliminate our dependence on foreign oil.LEHRER: All right, let\\'s go back to my question. How do you all stand on the recovery plan? And talk to each other about it. We\\'ve got five minutes. We can negotiate a deal right here.But, I mean, are you -- do you favor this plan, Senator Obama, and you, Senator McCain? Do you -- are you in favor of this plan?OBAMA: We haven\\'t seen the language yet. And I do think that there\\'s constructive work being done out there. So, for the viewers who are watching, I am optimistic about the capacity of us to come together with a plan.The question, I think, that we have to ask ourselves is, how did we get into this situation in the first place?Two years ago, I warned that, because of the subprime lending mess, because of the lax regulation, that we were potentially going to have a problem and tried to stop some of the abuses in mortgages that were taking place at the time.Last year, I wrote to the secretary of the Treasury to make sure that he understood the magnitude of this problem and to call on him to bring all the stakeholders together to try to deal with it.So -- so the question, I think, that we\\'ve got to ask ourselves is, yes, we\\'ve got to solve this problem short term. And we are going to have to intervene; there\\'s no doubt about that.But we\\'re also going to have to look at, how is it that we shredded so many regulations? We did not set up a 21st-century regulatory framework to deal with these problems. And that in part has to do with an economic philosophy that says that regulation is always bad.LEHRER: Are you going to vote for the plan, Senator McCain?MCCAIN: I -- I hope so. And I...LEHRER: As a United States senator...MCCAIN: Sure.LEHRER: ... you\\'re going to vote for the plan?MCCAIN: Sure. But -- but let me -- let me point out, I also warned about Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and warned about corporate greed and excess, and CEO pay, and all that. A lot of us saw this train wreck coming.But there\\'s also the issue of responsibility. You\\'ve mentioned President Dwight David Eisenhower. President Eisenhower, on the night before the Normandy invasion, went into his room, and he wrote out two letters.One of them was a letter congratulating the great members of the military and allies that had conducted and succeeded in the greatest invasion in history, still to this day, and forever.And he wrote out another letter, and that was a letter of resignation from the United States Army for the failure of the landings at Normandy.Somehow we\\'ve lost that accountability. I\\'ve been heavily criticized because I called for the resignation of the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. We\\'ve got to start also holding people accountable, and we\\'ve got to reward people who succeed.But somehow in Washington today -- and I\\'m afraid on Wall Street -- greed is rewarded, excess is rewarded, and corruption -- or certainly failure to carry out our responsibility is rewarded.As president of the United States, people are going to be held accountable in my administration. And I promise you that that will happen.LEHRER: Do you have something directly to say, Senator Obama, to Senator McCain about what he just said?OBAMA: Well, I think Senator McCain\\'s absolutely right that we need more responsibility, but we need it not just when there\\'s a crisis. I mean, we\\'ve had years in which the reigning economic ideology has been what\\'s good for Wall Street, but not what\\'s good for Main Street.And there are folks out there who\\'ve been struggling before this crisis took place. And that\\'s why it\\'s so important, as we solve this short-term problem, that we look at some of the underlying issues that have led to wages and incomes for ordinary Americans to go down, the -- a health care system that is broken, energy policies that are not working, because, you know, 10 days ago, John said that the fundamentals of the economy are sound.LEHRER: Say it directly to him.OBAMA: I do not think that they are.LEHRER: Say it directly to him.OBAMA: Well, the -- John, 10 days ago, you said that the fundamentals of the economy are sound. And...MCCAIN: Are you afraid I couldn\\'t hear him?(LAUGHTER)LEHRER: I\\'m just determined to get you all to talk to each other. I\\'m going to try.OBAMA: The -- and I just fundamentally disagree. And unless we are holding ourselves accountable day in, day out, not just when there\\'s a crisis for folks who have power and influence and can hire lobbyists, but for the nurse, the teacher, the police officer, who, frankly, at the end of each month, they\\'ve got a little financial crisis going on.They\\'re having to take out extra debt just to make their mortgage payments. We haven\\'t been paying attention to them. And if you look at our tax policies, it\\'s a classic example.LEHRER: So, Senator McCain, do you agree with what Senator Obama just said? And, if you don\\'t, tell him what you disagree with.MCCAIN: No, I -- look, we\\'ve got to fix the system. We\\'ve got fundamental problems in the system. And Main Street is paying a penalty for the excesses and greed in Washington, D.C., and in the Wall Street.So there\\'s no doubt that we have a long way to go. And, obviously, stricter interpretation and consolidation of the various regulatory agencies that weren\\'t doing their job, that has brought on this crisis.But I have a fundamental belief in the goodness and strength of the American worker. And the American worker is the most productive, the most innovative. America is still the greatest producer, exporter and importer.But we\\'ve got to get through these times, but I have a fundamental belief in the United States of America. And I still believe, under the right leadership, our best days are ahead of us.LEHRER: All right, let\\'s go to the next lead question, which is essentially following up on this same subject.And you get two minutes to begin with, Senator McCain. And using your word \"fundamental,\" are there fundamental differences between your approach and Senator Obama\\'s approach to what you would do as president to lead this country out of the financial crisis?MCCAIN: Well, the first thing we have to do is get spending under control in Washington. It\\'s completely out of control. It\\'s gone -- we have now presided over the largest increase in the size of government since the Great Society.We Republicans came to power to change government, and government changed us. And the -- the worst symptom on this disease is what my friend, Tom Coburn, calls earmarking as a gateway drug, because it\\'s a gateway. It\\'s a gateway to out-of-control spending and corruption.And we have former members of Congress now residing in federal prison because of the evils of this earmarking and pork-barrel spending.You know, we spent $3 million to study the DNA of bears in Montana. I don\\'t know if that was a criminal issue or a paternal issue, but the fact is that it was $3 million of our taxpayers\\' money. And it has got to be brought under control.As president of the United States, I want to assure you, I\\'ve got a pen. This one\\'s kind of old. I\\'ve got a pen, and I\\'m going to veto every single spending bill that comes across my desk. I will make them famous. You will know their names.Now, Senator Obama, you wanted to know one of the differences. He has asked for $932 million of earmark pork-barrel spending, nearly a million dollars for every day that he\\'s been in the United States Senate.I suggest that people go up on the Web site of Citizens Against Government Waste, and they\\'ll look at those projects.That kind of thing is not the way to rein in runaway spending in Washington, D.C. That\\'s one of the fundamental differences that Senator Obama and I have.LEHRER: Senator Obama, two minutes.OBAMA: Well, Senator McCain is absolutely right that the earmarks process has been abused, which is why I suspended any requests for my home state, whether it was for senior centers or what have you, until we cleaned it up.And he\\'s also right that oftentimes lobbyists and special interests are the ones that are introducing these kinds of requests, although that wasn\\'t the case with me.But let\\'s be clear: Earmarks account for $18 billion in last year\\'s budget. Senator McCain is proposing -- and this is a fundamental difference between us -- $300 billion in tax cuts to some of the wealthiest corporations and individuals in the country, $300 billion.Now, $18 billion is important; $300 billion is really important. And in his tax plan, you would have CEOs of Fortune 500 companies getting an average of $700,000 in reduced taxes, while leaving 100 million Americans out.So my attitude is, we\\'ve got to grow the economy from the bottom up. What I\\'ve called for is a tax cut for 95 percent of working families, 95 percent.And that means that the ordinary American out there who\\'s collecting a paycheck every day, they\\'ve got a little extra money to be able to buy a computer for their kid, to fill up on this gas that is killing them.And over time, that, I think, is going to be a better recipe for economic growth than the -- the policies of President Bush that John McCain wants to -- wants to follow.LEHRER: Senator McCain?MCCAIN: Well, again, I don\\'t mean to go back and forth, but he...(CROSSTALK)LEHRER: No, that\\'s fine.MCCAIN: Senator Obama suspended those requests for pork-barrel projects after he was running for president of the United States. He didn\\'t happen to see that light during the first three years as a member of the United States Senate, $932 million in requests.Maybe to Senator Obama it\\'s not a lot of money. But the point is that -- you see, I hear this all the time. \"It\\'s only $18 billion.\" Do you know that it\\'s tripled in the last five years? Do you know that it\\'s gone completely out of control to the point where it corrupts people? It corrupts people.That\\'s why we have, as I said, people under federal indictment and charges. It\\'s a system that\\'s got to be cleaned up.I have fought against it my career. I have fought against it. I was called the sheriff, by the -- one of the senior members of the Appropriations Committee. I didn\\'t win Miss Congeniality in the United States Senate.Now, Senator Obama didn\\'t mention that, along with his tax cuts, he is also proposing some $800 billion in new spending on new programs.Now, that\\'s a fundamental difference between myself and Senator Obama. I want to cut spending. I want to keep taxes low. The worst thing we could do in this economic climate is to raise people\\'s taxes.OBAMA: I -- I don\\'t know where John is getting his figures. Let\\'s just be clear.What I do is I close corporate loopholes, stop providing tax cuts to corporations that are shipping jobs overseas so that we\\'re giving tax breaks to companies that are investing here in the United States. I make sure that we have a health care system that allows for everyone to have basic coverage.I think those are pretty important priorities. And I pay for every dime of it.But let\\'s go back to the original point. John, nobody is denying that $18 billion is important. And, absolutely, we need earmark reform. And when I\\'m president, I will go line by line to make sure that we are not spending money unwisely.But the fact is that eliminating earmarks alone is not a recipe for how we\\'re going to get the middle class back on track.OBAMA: And when you look at your tax policies that are directed primarily at those who are doing well, and you are neglecting people who are really struggling right now, I think that is a continuation of the last eight years, and we can\\'t afford another four.LEHRER: Respond directly to him about that, to Senator Obama about that, about the -- he\\'s made it twice now, about your tax -- your policies about tax cuts.MCCAIN: Well -- well, let me give you an example of what Senator Obama finds objectionable, the business tax.Right now, in the United States of America, business pays the second-highest business taxes in the world, 35 percent. Ireland pays 11 percent.Now, if you\\'re a business person, and you can locate any place in the world, then, obviously, if you go to the country where it\\'s 11 percent tax versus 35 percent, you\\'re going to be able to create jobs, increase your business, make more investment, et cetera.I want to cut that business tax. I want to cut it so that businesses will remain in -- in the United States of America and create jobs.But, again, I want to return. It\\'s a lot more than $18 billion in pork-barrel spending. I can tell you, it\\'s rife. It\\'s throughout.The United States Senate will take up a continuing resolution tomorrow or the next day, sometime next week, with 2,000 -- 2,000 -- look at them, my friends. Look at them. You\\'ll be appalled.And Senator Obama is a recent convert, after requesting $932 million worth of pork-barrel spending projects.So the point is, I want people to have tax cuts. I want every family to have a $5,000 refundable tax credit so they can go out and purchase their own health care. I want to double the dividend from $3,500 to $7,000 for every dependent child in America.I know that the worst thing we could possibly do is to raise taxes on anybody, and a lot of people might be interested in Senator Obama\\'s definition of \"rich.\"LEHRER: Senator Obama, you have a question for Senator McCain on that?OBAMA: Well, let me just make a couple of points.LEHRER: All right.OBAMA: My definition -- here\\'s what I can tell the American people: 95 percent of you will get a tax cut. And if you make less than $250,000, less than a quarter-million dollars a year, then you will not see one dime\\'s worth of tax increase.Now, John mentioned the fact that business taxes on paper are high in this country, and he\\'s absolutely right. Here\\'s the problem: There are so many loopholes that have been written into the tax code, oftentimes with support of Senator McCain, that we actually see our businesses pay effectively one of the lowest tax rates in the world.And what that means, then, is that there are people out there who are working every day, who are not getting a tax cut, and you want to give them more.It\\'s not like you want to close the loopholes. You just want to add an additional tax cut over the loopholes. And that\\'s a problem.Just one last point I want to make, since Senator McCain talked about providing a $5,000 health credit. Now, what he doesn\\'t tell you is that he intends to, for the first time in history, tax health benefits.So you may end up getting a $5,000 tax credit. Here\\'s the only problem: Your employer now has to pay taxes on the health care that you\\'re getting from your employer. And if you end up losing your health care from your employer, you\\'ve got to go out on the open market and try to buy it.It is not a good deal for the American people. But it\\'s an example of this notion that the market can always solve everything and that the less regulation we have, the better off we\\'re going to be.MCCAIN: Well, you know, let me just...LEHRER: We\\'ve got to go to another lead question.MCCAIN: I know we have to, but this is a classic example of walking the walk and talking the talk.We had an energy bill before the United States Senate. It was festooned with Christmas tree ornaments. It had all kinds of breaks for the oil companies, I mean, billions of dollars worth. I voted against it; Senator Obama voted for it.OBAMA: John, you want to give oil companies another $4 billion.MCCAIN: You\\'ve got to look at our record. You\\'ve got to look at our records. That\\'s the important thing.Who fought against wasteful and earmark spending? Who has been the person who has tried to keep spending under control?Who\\'s the person who has believed that the best thing for America is -- is to have a tax system that is fundamentally fair? And I\\'ve fought to simplify it, and I have proposals to simplify it.Let\\'s give every American a choice: two tax brackets, generous dividends, and, two -- and let Americans choose whether they want the -- the existing tax code or they want a new tax code.And so, again, look at the record, particularly the energy bill. But, again, Senator Obama has shifted on a number of occasions. He has voted in the United States Senate to increase taxes on people who make as low as $42,000 a year.OBAMA: That\\'s not true, John. That\\'s not true.MCCAIN: And that\\'s just a fact. Again, you can look it up.OBAMA: Look, it\\'s just not true. And if we want to talk about oil company profits, under your tax plan, John -- this is undeniable -- oil companies would get an additional $4 billion in tax breaks.Now, look, we all would love to lower taxes on everybody. But here\\'s the problem: If we are giving them to oil companies, then that means that there are those who are not going to be getting them. And...MCCAIN: With all due respect, you already gave them to the oil companies.OBAMA: No, but, John, the fact of the matter is, is that I was opposed to those tax breaks, tried to strip them out. We\\'ve got an energy bill on the Senate floor right now that contains some good stuff, some stuff you want, including drilling off-shore, but you\\'re opposed to it because it would strip away those tax breaks that have gone to oil companies.LEHRER: All right. All right, speaking of things that both of you want, another lead question, and it has to do with the rescue -- the financial rescue thing that we started -- started asking about.And what -- and the first answer is to you, Senator Obama. As president, as a result of whatever financial rescue plan comes about and the billion, $700 billion, whatever it is it\\'s going to cost, what are you going to have to give up, in terms of the priorities that you would bring as president of the United States, as a result of having to pay for the financial rescue plan?OBAMA: Well, there are a range of things that are probably going to have to be delayed. We don\\'t yet know what our tax revenues are going to be. The economy is slowing down, so it\\'s hard to anticipate right now what the budget is going to look like next year.But there\\'s no doubt that we\\'re not going to be able to do everything that I think needs to be done. There are some things that I think have to be done.We have to have energy independence, so I\\'ve put forward a plan to make sure that, in 10 years\\' time, we have freed ourselves from dependence on Middle Eastern oil by increasing production at home, but most importantly by starting to invest in alternative energy, solar, wind, biodiesel, making sure that we\\'re developing the fuel-efficient cars of the future right here in the United States, in Ohio and Michigan, instead of Japan and South Korea.We have to fix our health care system, which is putting an enormous burden on families. Just -- a report just came out that the average deductible went up 30 percent on American families.They are getting crushed, and many of them are going bankrupt as a consequence of health care. I\\'m meeting folks all over the country. We have to do that now, because it will actually make our businesses and our families better off.The third thing we have to do is we\\'ve got to make sure that we\\'re competing in education. We\\'ve got to invest in science and technology. China had a space launch and a space walk. We\\'ve got to make sure that our children are keeping pace in math and in science.And one of the things I think we have to do is make sure that college is affordable for every young person in America.And I also think that we\\'re going to have to rebuild our infrastructure, which is falling behind, our roads, our bridges, but also broadband lines that reach into rural communities.Also, making sure that we have a new electricity grid to get the alternative energy to population centers that are using them.So there are some -- some things that we\\'ve got to do structurally to make sure that we can compete in this global economy. We can\\'t shortchange those things. We\\'ve got to eliminate programs that don\\'t work, and we\\'ve got to make sure that the programs that we do have are more efficient and cost less.LEHRER: Are you -- what priorities would you adjust, as president, Senator McCain, because of the -- because of the financial bailout cost?MCCAIN: Look, we, no matter what, we\\'ve got to cut spending. We have -- as I said, we\\'ve let government get completely out of control.Senator Obama has the most liberal voting record in the United States Senate. It\\'s hard to reach across the aisle from that far to the left.The point -- the point is -- the point is, we need to examine every agency of government.First of all, by the way, I\\'d eliminate ethanol subsidies. I oppose ethanol subsidies.I think that we have to return -- particularly in defense spending, which is the largest part of our appropriations -- we have to do away with cost-plus contracts. We now have defense systems that the costs are completely out of control.We tried to build a little ship called the Littoral Combat Ship that was supposed to cost $140 million, ended up costing $400 million, and we still haven\\'t done it.So we need to have fixed-cost contracts. We need very badly to understand that defense spending is very important and vital, particularly in the new challenges we face in the world, but we have to get a lot of the cost overruns under control.I know how to do that.MCCAIN: I saved the taxpayers $6.8 billion by fighting a contract that was negotiated between Boeing and DOD that was completely wrong. And we fixed it and we killed it and the people ended up in federal prison so I know how to do this because I\\'ve been involved these issues for many, many years. But I think that we have to examine every agency of government and find out those that are doing their job and keep them and find out those that aren\\'t and eliminate them and we\\'ll have to scrub every agency of government.LEHRER: But if I hear the two of you correctly neither one of you is suggesting any major changes in what you want to do as president as a result of the financial bailout? Is that what you\\'re saying?OBAMA: No. As I said before, Jim, there are going to be things that end up having to be ...LEHRER: Like what?OBAMA: ... deferred and delayed. Well, look, I want to make sure that we are investing in energy in order to free ourselves from the dependence on foreign oil. That is a big project. That is a multi-year project.LEHRER: Not willing to give that up?OBAMA: Not willing to give up the need to do it but there may be individual components that we can\\'t do. But John is right we have to make cuts. We right now give $15 billion every year as subsidies to private insurers under the Medicare system. Doesn\\'t work any better through the private insurers. They just skim off $15 billion. That was a give away and part of the reason is because lobbyists are able to shape how Medicare works.They did it on the Medicaid prescription drug bill and we have to change the culture. Tom -- or John mentioned me being wildly liberal. Mostly that\\'s just me opposing George Bush\\'s wrong headed policies since I\\'ve been in Congress but I think it is that it is also important to recognize I worked with Tom Coburn, the most conservative, one of the most conservative Republicans who John already mentioned to set up what we call a Google for government saying we\\'ll list every dollar of federal spending to make sure that the taxpayer can take a look and see who, in fact, is promoting some of these spending projects that John\\'s been railing about.LEHRER: What I\\'m trying to get at this is this. Excuse me if I may, senator. Trying to get at that you all -- one of you is going to be the president of the United States come January. At the -- in the middle of a huge financial crisis that is yet to be resolved. And what I\\'m trying to get at is how this is going to affect you not in very specific -- small ways but in major ways and the approach to take as to the presidency.MCCAIN: How about a spending freeze on everything but defense, veteran affairs and entitlement programs.LEHRER: Spending freeze?MCCAIN: I think we ought to seriously consider with the exceptions of caring for our veterans national defense and several other vital issues.LEHRER: Would you go for that?OBAMA: The problem with a spending freeze is you\\'re using a hatchet where you need a scalpel. There are some programs that are very important that are under funded. I went to increase early childhood education and the notion that we should freeze that when there may be, for example, this Medicare subsidy, I think, doesn\\'t make sense.Let me tell you another place to look for some savings. We are currently spending $10 billion a month in Iraq when they have a $79 billion surplus. It seems to me that if we\\'re going to be strong at home as well as strong abroad, that we have to look at bringing that war to a close.MCCAIN: Look, we are sending $700 billion a year overseas to countries that don\\'t like us very much. Some of that money ends up in the hands of terrorist organizations. We have to have wind, tide, solar, natural gas, flex fuel cars and all that but we also have to have offshore drilling and we also have to have nuclear power.Senator Obama opposes both storing and reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel. You can\\'t get there from here and the fact is that we can create 700,000 jobs by building constructing 45 new nuclear power plants by the year 2030. Nuclear power is not only important as far as eliminating our dependence on foreign oil but it\\'s also responsibility as far as climate change is concerned. An issue I have been involved in for many, many years and I\\'m proud of the work of the work that I\\'ve done there along with Senator Clinton.LEHRER: Before we go to another lead question. Let me figure out a way to ask the same question in a slightly different way here. Are you -- are you willing to acknowledge both of you that this financial crisis is going to affect the way you rule the country as president of the United States beyond the kinds of things that you have already -- I mean, is it a major move? Is it going to have a major affect?OBAMA: There\\'s no doubt itâ€™s gonna affect our budgets. There is no doubt about it. Not only -- Even if we get all $700 billion back, let\\'s assume the markets recover, we\\'re holding assets long enough that eventually taxpayers get it back and that happened during the Great Depression when Roosevelt purchased a whole bunch of homes, over time, home values went back up and in fact government made a profit. If we\\'re lucky and we do it right, that could potentially happen but in the short term there\\'s an outlay and we may not see that money for a while.And because of the economy\\'s slowing down, I think we can also expect less tax revenue so there\\'s no doubt that as president I\\'m going to have to make some tough decision.The only point I want to make is this, that in order to make those tough decisions we have to know what our values are and who we\\'re fighting for and what our priorities are and if we are spending $300 billion on tax cuts for people who don\\'t need them and weren\\'t even asking for them, and we are leaving out health care which is crushing on people all across the country, then I think we have made a bad decision and I want to make sure we\\'re not shortchanging our long term priorities.MCCAIN: Well, I want to make sure we\\'re not handing the health care system over to the federal government which is basically what would ultimately happen with Senator Obama\\'s health care plan. I want the families to make decisions between themselves and their doctors. Not the federal government. Look. We have to obviously cut spending. I have fought to cut spending. Senator Obama has $800 billion in new spending programs. I would suggest he start by canceling some of those new spending program that he has.We can\\'t I think adjust spending around to take care of the very much needed programs, including taking care of our veterans but I also want to say again a healthy economy with low taxes would not raising anyone\\'s taxes is probably the best recipe for eventually having our economy recover.And spending restraint has got to be a vital part of that. And the reason, one of the major reasons why we\\'re in the difficulties we are in today is because spending got out of control. We owe China $500 billion. And spending, I know, can be brought under control because I have fought against excessive spending my entire career. And I got plans to reduce and eliminate unnecessary and wasteful spending and if there\\'s anybody here who thinks there aren\\'t agencies of government where spending can be cut and their budgets slashed they have not spent a lot of time in Washington.OBAMA: I just want to make this point, Jim. John, it\\'s been your president who you said you agreed with 90 percent of the time who presided over this increase in spending. This orgy of spending and enormous deficits you voted for almost all of his budgets. So to stand here and after eight years and say that you\\'re going to lead on controlling spending and, you know, balancing our tax cuts so that they help middle class families when over the last eight years that hasn\\'t happened I think just is, you know, kind of hard to swallow.LEHRER: Quick response to Senator Obama.MCCAIN: It\\'s well-known that I have not been elected Miss Congeniality in the United States Senate nor with the administration. I have opposed the president on spending, on climate change, on torture of prisoner, on - on Guantanamo Bay. On a -- on the way that the Iraq War was conducted. I have a long record and the American people know me very well and that is independent and a maverick of the Senate and I\\'m happy to say that I\\'ve got a partner that\\'s a good maverick along with me now.LEHRER: All right. Let\\'s go another subject. Lead question, two minutes to you, senator McCain. Much has been said about the lessons of Vietnam. What do you see as the lessons of Iraq?MCCAIN: I think the lessons of Iraq are very clear that you cannot have a failed strategy that will then cause you to nearly lose a conflict. Our initial military success, we went in to Baghdad and everybody celebrated. And then the war was very badly mishandled. I went to Iraq in 2003 and came back and said, we\\'ve got to change this strategy. This strategy requires additional troops, it requires a fundamental change in strategy and I fought for it. And finally, we came up with a great general and a strategy that has succeeded.This strategy has succeeded. And we are winning in Iraq. And we will come home with victory and with honor. And that withdrawal is the result of every counterinsurgency that succeeds.MCCAIN: And I want to tell you that now that we will succeed and our troops will come home, and not in defeat, that we will see a stable ally in the region and a fledgling democracy.The consequences of defeat would have been increased Iranian influence. It would have been increase in sectarian violence. It would have been a wider war, which the United States of America might have had to come back.So there was a lot at stake there. And thanks to this great general, David Petraeus, and the troops who serve under him, they have succeeded. And we are winning in Iraq, and we will come home. And we will come home as we have when we have won other wars and not in defeat.LEHRER: Two minutes, how you see the lessons of Iraq, Senator Obama.OBAMA: Well, this is an area where Senator McCain and I have a fundamental difference because I think the first question is whether we should have gone into the war in the first place.Now six years ago, I stood up and opposed this war at a time when it was politically risky to do so because I said that not only did we not know how much it was going to cost, what our exit strategy might be, how it would affect our relationships around the world, and whether our intelligence was sound, but also because we hadn\\'t finished the job in Afghanistan.We hadn\\'t caught bin Laden. We hadn\\'t put al Qaeda to rest, and as a consequence, I thought that it was going to be a distraction. Now Senator McCain and President Bush had a very different judgment.And I wish I had been wrong for the sake of the country and they had been right, but that\\'s not the case. We\\'ve spent over $600 billion so far, soon to be $1 trillion. We have lost over 4,000 lives. We have seen 30,000 wounded, and most importantly, from a strategic national security perspective, al Qaeda is resurgent, stronger now than at any time since 2001.We took our eye off the ball. And not to mention that we are still spending $10 billion a month, when they have a $79 billion surplus, at a time when we are in great distress here at home, and we just talked about the fact that our budget is way overstretched and we are borrowing money from overseas to try to finance just some of the basic functions of our government.So I think the lesson to be drawn is that we should never hesitate to use military force, and I will not, as president, in order to keep the American people safe. But we have to use our military wisely. And we did not use our military wisely in Iraq.LEHRER: Do you agree with that, the lesson of Iraq?MCCAIN: The next president of the United States is not going to have to address the issue as to whether we went into Iraq or not. The next president of the United States is going to have to decide how we leave, when we leave, and what we leave behind. That\\'s the decision of the next president of the United States.Senator Obama said the surge could not work, said it would increase sectarian violence, said it was doomed to failure. Recently on a television program, he said it exceed our wildest expectations.But yet, after conceding that, he still says that he would oppose the surge if he had to decide that again today. Incredibly, incredibly Senator Obama didn\\'t go to Iraq for 900 days and never asked for a meeting with General Petraeus.LEHRER: Well, let\\'s go at some of these things...MCCAIN: Senator Obama is the chairperson of a committee that oversights NATO that\\'s in Afghanistan. To this day, he has never had a hearing.LEHRER: What about that point?MCCAIN: I mean, it\\'s remarkable.LEHRER: All right. What about that point?OBAMA: Which point? He raised a whole bunch of them.LEHRER: I know, OK, let\\'s go to the latter point and we\\'ll back up. The point about your not having been...OBAMA: Look, I\\'m very proud of my vice presidential selection, Joe Biden, who is the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and as he explains, and as John well knows, the issues of Afghanistan, the issues of Iraq, critical issues like that, don\\'t go through my subcommittee because they\\'re done as a committee as a whole.But that\\'s Senate inside baseball. But let\\'s get back to the core issue here. Senator McCain is absolutely right that the violence has been reduced as a consequence of the extraordinary sacrifice of our troops and our military families.They have done a brilliant job, and General Petraeus has done a brilliant job. But understand, that was a tactic designed to contain the damage of the previous four years of mismanagement of this war.And so John likes -- John, you like to pretend like the war started in 2007. You talk about the surge. The war started in 2003, and at the time when the war started, you said it was going to be quick and easy. You said we knew where the weapons of mass destruction were. You were wrong.You said that we were going to be greeted as liberators. You were wrong. You said that there was no history of violence between Shia and Sunni. And you were wrong. And so my question is...(CROSSTALK)LEHRER: Senator Obama...OBAMA: ... of judgment, of whether or not -- of whether or not -- if the question is who is best-equipped as the next president to make good decisions about how we use our military, how we make sure that we are prepared and ready for the next conflict, then I think we can take a look at our judgment.LEHRER: I have got a lot on the plate here...MCCAIN: I\\'m afraid Senator Obama doesn\\'t understand the difference between a tactic and a strategy. But the important -- I\\'d like to tell you, two Fourths of July ago I was in Baghdad. General Petraeus invited Senator Lindsey Graham and me to attend a ceremony where 688 brave young Americans, whose enlistment had expired, were reenlisting to stay and fight for Iraqi freedom and American freedom.I was honored to be there. I was honored to speak to those troops. And you know, afterwards, we spent a lot of time with them. And you know what they said to us? They said, let us win. They said, let us win. We don\\'t want our kids coming back here.And this strategy, and this general, they are winning. Senator Obama refuses to acknowledge that we are winning in Iraq.OBAMA: That\\'s not true.MCCAIN: They just passed an electoral...OBAMA: That\\'s not true.MCCAIN: An election law just in the last few days. There is social, economic progress, and a strategy, a strategy of going into an area, clearing and holding, and the people of the country then become allied with you. They inform on the bad guys. And peace comes to the country, and prosperity.That\\'s what\\'s happening in Iraq, and it wasn\\'t a tactic.LEHRER: Let me see...OBAMA: Jim, Jim, this is a big...MCCAIN: It was a strategy. And that same strategy will be employed in Afghanistan by this great general. And Senator Obama, who after promising not to vote to cut off funds for the troops, did the incredible thing of voting to cut off the funds for the troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.OBAMA: Jim, there are a whole bunch of things we have got to answer. First of all, let\\'s talk about this troop funding issue because John always brings this up. Senator McCain cut -- Senator McCain opposed funding for troops in legislation that had a timetable, because he didn\\'t believe in a timetable.I opposed funding a mission that had no timetable, and was open- ended, giving a blank check to George Bush. We had a difference on the timetable. We didn\\'t have a difference on whether or not we were going to be funding troops.We had a legitimate difference, and I absolutely understand the difference between tactics and strategy. And the strategic question that the president has to ask is not whether or not we are employing a particular approach in the country once we have made the decision to be there.The question is, was this wise? We have seen Afghanistan worsen, deteriorate. We need more troops there. We need more resources there. Senator McCain, in the rush to go into Iraq, said, you know what? We\\'ve been successful in Afghanistan. There is nobody who can pose a threat to us there.This is a time when bin Laden was still out, and now they\\'ve reconstituted themselves. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates himself acknowledges the war on terrorism started in Afghanistan and it needs to end there.But we can\\'t do it if we are not willing to give Iraq back its country. Now, what I\\'ve said is we should end this war responsibly. We should do it in phases. But in 16 months we should be able to reduce our combat troops, put -- provide some relief to military families and our troops and bolster our efforts in Afghanistan so that we can capture and kill bin Laden and crush al Qaeda.And right now, the commanders in Afghanistan, as well as Admiral Mullen, have acknowledged that we don\\'t have enough troops to deal with Afghanistan because we still have more troops in Iraq than we did before the surge.MCCAIN: Admiral Mullen suggests that Senator Obama\\'s plan is dangerous for America.OBAMA: That\\'s not the case.MCCAIN: That\\'s what ...OBAMA: What he said was a precipitous...MCCAIN: That\\'s what Admiral Mullen said.OBAMA: ... withdrawal would be dangerous. He did not say that. That\\'s not true.MCCAIN: And also General Petraeus said the same thing. Osama bin Laden and General Petraeus have one thing in common that I know of, they both said that Iraq is the central battleground.Now General Petraeus has praised the successes, but he said those successes are fragile and if we set a specific date for withdrawal -- and by the way, Senator Obama\\'s original plan, they would have been out last spring before the surge ever had a chance to succeed.And I\\'m -- I\\'m -- understand why Senator Obama was surprised and said that the surge succeeded beyond his wildest expectations.MCCAIN: It didn\\'t exceed beyond mine, because I know that that\\'s a strategy that has worked and can succeed. But if we snatch defeat from the jaws of victory and adopt Senator Obama\\'s plan, then we will have a wider war and it will make things more complicated throughout the region, including in Afghanistan.LEHRER: Afghanistan, lead -- a new -- a new lead question. Now, having resolved Iraq, we\\'ll move to Afghanistan.(LAUGHTER)And it goes to you, Senator Obama, and it\\'s a -- it picks up on a point that\\'s already been made. Do you think more troops -- more U.S. troops should be sent to Afghanistan, how many, and when?OBAMA: Yes, I think we need more troops. I\\'ve been saying that for over a year now.And I think that we have to do it as quickly as possible, because it\\'s been acknowledged by the commanders on the ground the situation is getting worse, not better.We had the highest fatalities among U.S. troops this past year than at any time since 2002. And we are seeing a major offensive taking place -- Al Qaida and Taliban crossing the border and attacking our troops in a brazen fashion. They are feeling emboldened.And we cannot separate Afghanistan from Iraq, because what our commanders have said is we don\\'t have the troops right now to deal with Afghanistan.So I would send two to three additional brigades to Afghanistan. Now, keep in mind that we have four times the number of troops in Iraq, where nobody had anything to do with 9/11 before we went in, where, in fact, there was no Al Qaida before we went in, but we have four times more troops there than we do in Afghanistan.And that is a strategic mistake, because every intelligence agency will acknowledge that Al Qaida is the greatest threat against the United States and that Secretary of Defense Gates acknowledged the central front -- that the place where we have to deal with these folks is going to be in Afghanistan and in Pakistan.So here\\'s what we have to do comprehensively, though. It\\'s not just more troops.We have to press the Afghan government to make certain that they are actually working for their people. And I\\'ve said this to President Karzai.Number two, we\\'ve got to deal with a growing poppy trade that has exploded over the last several years.Number three, we\\'ve got to deal with Pakistan, because Al Qaida and the Taliban have safe havens in Pakistan, across the border in the northwest regions, and although, you know, under George Bush, with the support of Senator McCain, we\\'ve been giving them $10 billion over the last seven years, they have not done what needs to be done to get rid of those safe havens.And until we do, Americans here at home are not going to be safe.LEHRER: Afghanistan, Senator McCain?MCCAIN: First of all, I won\\'t repeat the mistake that I regret enormously, and that is, after we were able to help the Afghan freedom fighters and drive the Russians out of Afghanistan, we basically washed our hands of the region.And the result over time was the Taliban, Al Qaida, and a lot of the difficulties we are facing today. So we can\\'t ignore those lessons of history.Now, on this issue of aiding Pakistan, if you\\'re going to aim a gun at somebody, George Shultz, our great secretary of state, told me once, you\\'d better be prepared to pull the trigger.I\\'m not prepared at this time to cut off aid to Pakistan. So I\\'m not prepared to threaten it, as Senator Obama apparently wants to do, as he has said that he would announce military strikes into Pakistan.We\\'ve got to get the support of the people of -- of Pakistan. He said that he would launch military strikes into Pakistan.Now, you don\\'t do that. You don\\'t say that out loud. If you have to do things, you have to do things, and you work with the Pakistani government.Now, the new president of Pakistan, Kardari (sic), has got his hands full. And this area on the border has not been governed since the days of Alexander the Great.I\\'ve been to Waziristan. I can see how tough that terrain is. It\\'s ruled by a handful of tribes.And, yes, Senator Obama calls for more troops, but what he doesn\\'t understand, it\\'s got to be a new strategy, the same strategy that he condemned in Iraq. It\\'s going to have to be employed in Afghanistan.And we\\'re going to have to help the Pakistanis go into these areas and obtain the allegiance of the people. And it\\'s going to be tough. They\\'ve intermarried with Al Qaida and the Taliban. And it\\'s going to be tough. But we have to get the cooperation of the people in those areas.And the Pakistanis are going to have to understand that that bombing in the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad was a signal from the terrorists that they don\\'t want that government to cooperate with us in combating the Taliban and jihadist elements.So we\\'ve got a lot of work to do in Afghanistan. But I\\'m confident, now that General Petraeus is in the new position of command, that we will employ a strategy which not only means additional troops -- and, by the way, there have been 20,000 additional troops, from 32,000 to 53,000, and there needs to be more.So it\\'s not just the addition of troops that matters. It\\'s a strategy that will succeed. And Pakistan is a very important element in this. And I know how to work with them. And I guarantee you I would not publicly state that I\\'m going to attack them.OBAMA: Nobody talked about attacking Pakistan. Here\\'s what I said.And if John wants to disagree with this, he can let me know, that, if the United States has Al Qaida, bin Laden, top-level lieutenants in our sights, and Pakistan is unable or unwilling to act, then we should take them out.Now, I think that\\'s the right strategy; I think that\\'s the right policy.And, John, I -- you\\'re absolutely right that presidents have to be prudent in what they say. But, you know, coming from you, who, you know, in the past has threatened extinction for North Korea and, you know, sung songs about bombing Iran, I don\\'t know, you know, how credible that is. I think this is the right strategy.Now, Senator McCain is also right that it\\'s difficult. This is not an easy situation. You\\'ve got cross-border attacks against U.S. troops.And we\\'ve got a choice. We could allow our troops to just be on the defensive and absorb those blows again and again and again, if Pakistan is unwilling to cooperate, or we have to start making some decisions.And the problem, John, with the strategy that\\'s been pursued was that, for 10 years, we coddled Musharraf, we alienated the Pakistani population, because we were anti-democratic. We had a 20th-century mindset that basically said, \"Well, you know, he may be a dictator, but he\\'s our dictator.\"And as a consequence, we lost legitimacy in Pakistan. We spent $10 billion. And in the meantime, they weren\\'t going after Al Qaida, and they are more powerful now than at any time since we began the war in Afghanistan.That\\'s going to change when I\\'m president of the United States.MCCAIN: I -- I don\\'t think that Senator Obama understands that there was a failed state in Pakistan when Musharraf came to power. Everybody who was around then, and had been there, and knew about it knew that it was a failed state.But let me tell you, you know, this business about bombing Iran and all that, let me tell you my record.Back in 1983, when I was a brand-new United States congressman, the one -- the person I admired the most and still admire the most, Ronald Reagan, wanted to send Marines into Lebanon.And I saw that, and I saw the situation, and I stood up, and I voted against that, because I was afraid that they couldn\\'t make peace in a place where 300 or 400 or several hundred Marines would make a difference. Tragically, I was right: Nearly 300 Marines lost their lives in the bombing of the barracks.And then we had Somalia -- then we had the first Gulf War. I supported -- I supported that.I supported us going into Bosnia, when a number of my own party and colleagues was against that operation in Bosnia. That was the right thing to do, to stop genocide and to preserve what was necessary inside of Europe.I supported what we did in Kosovo. I supported it because ethnic cleansing and genocide was taking place there.And I have a record -- and Somalia, I opposed that we should turn -- turn the force in Somalia from a peacekeeping force into a peacemaking force, which they were not capable of.So I have a record. I have a record of being involved in these national security issues, which involve the highest responsibility and the toughest decisions that any president can make, and that is to send our young men and women into harm\\'s way.And I\\'ll tell you, I had a town hall meeting in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, and a woman stood up and she said, \"Senator McCain, I want you to do me the honor of wearing a bracelet with my son\\'s name on it.\"He was 22 years old and he was killed in combat outside of Baghdad, Matthew Stanley, before Christmas last year. This was last August, a year ago. And I said, \"I will -- I will wear his bracelet with honor.\"And this was August, a year ago. And then she said, \"But, Senator McCain, I want you to do everything -- promise me one thing, that you\\'ll do everything in your power to make sure that my son\\'s death was not in vain.\"That means that that mission succeeds, just like those young people who re-enlisted in Baghdad, just like the mother I met at the airport the other day whose son was killed. And they all say to me that we don\\'t want defeat. I know what thatâ€™s like when an army is defeated.MCCAIN: A war that I was in, where we had an Army, that it wasn\\'t through any fault of their own, but they were defeated. And I know how hard it is for that -- for an Army and a military to recover from that. And it did and we will win this one and we won\\'t come home in defeat and dishonor and probably have to go back if we fail.OBAMA: Jim, let me just make a point. I\\'ve got a bracelet, too, from Sergeant - from the mother of Sergeant Ryan David Jopeck (ph), given to me in green bay. She asked me, can you please make sure another mother is not going through what I\\'m going through.No U.S. soldier ever dies in vain because they\\'re carrying out the missions of their commander in chief. And we honor all the service that they\\'ve provided. Our troops have performed brilliantly. The question is for the next president, are we making good judgments about how to keep America safe precisely because sending our military into battle is such an enormous step.And the point that I originally made is that we took our eye off Afghanistan, we took our eye off the folks who perpetrated 9/11, they are still sending out videotapes and Senator McCain, nobody is talking about defeat in Iraq, but I have to say we are having enormous problems in Afghanistan because of that decision.And it is not true you have consistently been concerned about what happened in Afghanistan. At one point, while you were focused on Iraq, you said well, we can \"muddle through\" Afghanistan. You don\\'t muddle through the central front on terror and you don\\'t muddle through going after bin Laden. You don\\'t muddle through stamping out the Taliban.I think that is something we have to take seriously. And when I\\'m president, I will.LEHRER: New ...MCCAIN: You might think that with that kind of concern that Senator Obama would have gone to Afghanistan, particularly given his responsibilities as a subcommittee chairman. By the way, when I\\'m subcommittee chairman, we take up the issues under my subcommittee. But the important thing is -- the important thing is I visited Afghanistan and I traveled to Waziristan and I traveled to these places and I know what our security requirements are. I know what our needs are. So the point is that we will prevail in Afghanistan, but we need the new strategy and we need it to succeed.But the important thing is, if we suffer defeat in Iraq, which General Petraeus predicts we will, if we adopted Senator Obama\\'s set date for withdrawal, then that will have a calamitous effect in Afghanistan and American national security interests in the region. Senator Obama doesn\\'t seem to understand there is a connected between the two.LEHRER: I have some good news and bad news for the two of you. You all are even on time, which is remarkable, considering we\\'ve been going at it ...OBAMA: A testimony to you, Jim.LEHRER: I don\\'t know about that. But the bad news is all my little five minute things have run over, so, anyhow, we\\'ll adjust as we get there. But the amount of time is even.New lead question. And it goes two minutes to you, Senator McCain, what is your reading on the threat from Iran right now to the security of the United States?MCCAIN: My reading of the threat from Iran is that if Iran acquires nuclear weapons, it is an existential threat to the State of Israel and it is a threat to other countries in the region because the other countries in the region will feel compelling requirement to acquire nuclear weapons as well.Now we cannot allow a second Holocaust. Let\\'s just make that very clear. What I have proposed for a long time, and I\\'ve had conversation with foreign leaders about forming a league of democracies, let\\'s be clear and let\\'s have some straight talk. The Russians are preventing significant action in the United Nations Security Council.I have proposed a league of democracies, a group of people - a group of countries that share common interests, common values, common ideals, they also control a lot of the world\\'s economic power. We could impose significant meaningful, painful sanctions on the Iranians that I think could have a beneficial effect.The Iranians have a lousy government, so therefore their economy is lousy, even though they have significant oil revenues. So I am convinced that together, we can, with the French, with the British, with the Germans and other countries, democracies around the world, we can affect Iranian behavior.But have no doubt, but have no doubt that the Iranians continue on the path to the acquisition of a nuclear weapon as we speak tonight. And it is a threat not only in this region but around the world.What I\\'d also like to point out the Iranians are putting the most lethal IEDs into Iraq which are killing young Americans, there are special groups in Iran coming into Iraq and are being trained in Iran. There is the Republican Guard in Iran, which Senator Kyl had an amendment in order to declare them a sponsor of terror. Senator Obama said that would be provocative.So this is a serious threat. This is a serious threat to security in the world, and I believe we can act and we can act with our friends and allies and reduce that threat as quickly as possible, but have no doubt about the ultimate result of them acquiring nuclear weapons.LEHRER: Two minutes on Iran, Senator Obama.OBAMA: Well, let me just correct something very quickly. I believe the Republican Guard of Iran is a terrorist organization. I\\'ve consistently said so. What Senator McCain refers to is a measure in the Senate that would try to broaden the mandate inside of Iraq. To deal with Iran.And ironically, the single thing that has strengthened Iran over the last several years has been the war in Iraq. Iraq was Iran\\'s mortal enemy. That was cleared away. And what we\\'ve seen over the last several years is Iran\\'s influence grow. They have funded Hezbollah, they have funded Hamas, they have gone from zero centrifuges to 4,000 centrifuges to develop a nuclear weapon.So obviously, our policy over the last eight years has not worked. Senator McCain is absolutely right, we cannot tolerate a nuclear Iran. It would be a game changer. Not only would it threaten Israel, a country that is our stalwart ally, but it would also create an environment in which you could set off an arms race in this Middle East.Now here\\'s what we need to do. We do need tougher sanctions. I do not agree with Senator McCain that we\\'re going to be able to execute the kind of sanctions we need without some cooperation with countries like Russia and China that are, I think Senator McCain would agree, not democracies, but have extensive trade with Iran but potentially have an interest in making sure Iran doesn\\'t have a nuclear weapon.But we are also going to have to, I believe, engage in tough direct diplomacy with Iran and this is a major difference I have with Senator McCain, this notion that by not talking to people we are punishing them has not worked. It has not worked in Iran, it has not worked in North Korea. In each instance, our efforts at isolation have actually accelerated their efforts to get nuclear weapons. That will change when I\\'m president of the United States.LEHRER: Senator, what about talking?MCCAIN: Senator Obama twice said in debates he would sit down with Ahmadinejad, Chavez and Raul Castro without precondition. Without precondition. Here is Ahmadinenene (ph), Ahmadinejad, who is, Ahmadinejad, who is now in New York, talking about the extermination of the State of Israel, of wiping Israel off the map, and we\\'re going to sit down, without precondition, across the table, to legitimize and give a propaganda platform to a person that is espousing the extermination of the state of Israel, and therefore then giving them more credence in the world arena and therefore saying, they\\'ve probably been doing the right thing, because you will sit down across the table from them and that will legitimize their illegal behavior.The point is that throughout history, whether it be Ronald Reagan, who wouldn\\'t sit down with Brezhnev, Andropov or Chernenko until Gorbachev was ready with glasnost and perestroika.Or whether it be Nixon\\'s trip to China, which was preceded by Henry Kissinger, many times before he went. Look, I\\'ll sit down with anybody, but there\\'s got to be pre-conditions. Those pre-conditions would apply that we wouldn\\'t legitimize with a face to face meeting, a person like Ahmadinejad. Now, Senator Obama said, without preconditions.OBAMA: So let\\'s talk about this. First of all, Ahmadinejad is not the most powerful person in Iran. So he may not be the right person to talk to. But I reserve the right, as president of the United States to meet with anybody at a time and place of my choosing if I think it\\'s going to keep America safe.And I\\'m glad that Senator McCain brought up the history, the bipartisan history of us engaging in direct diplomacy.OBAMA: Senator McCain mentioned Henry Kissinger, who\\'s one of his advisers, who, along with five recent secretaries of state, just said that we should meet with Iran -- guess what -- without precondition. This is one of your own advisers.Now, understand what this means \"without preconditions.\" It doesn\\'t mean that you invite them over for tea one day. What it means is that we don\\'t do what we\\'ve been doing, which is to say, \"Until you agree to do exactly what we say, we won\\'t have direct contacts with you.\"There\\'s a difference between preconditions and preparation. Of course we\\'ve got to do preparations, starting with low-level diplomatic talks, and it may not work, because Iran is a rogue regime. But I will point out that I was called naive when I suggested that we need to look at exploring contacts with Iran. And you know what? President Bush recently sent a senior ambassador, Bill Burns, to participate in talks with the Europeans around the issue of nuclear weapons.Again, it may not work, but if it doesn\\'t work, then we have strengthened our ability to form alliances to impose the tough sanctions that Senator McCain just mentioned.And when we haven\\'t done it, as in North Korea -- let me just take one more example -- in North Korea, we cut off talks. They\\'re a member of the axis of evil. We can\\'t deal with them.And you know what happened? They went -- they quadrupled their nuclear capacity. They tested a nuke. They tested missiles. They pulled out of the nonproliferation agreement. And they sent nuclear secrets, potentially, to countries like Syria.When we re-engaged -- because, again, the Bush administration reversed course on this -- then we have at least made some progress, although right now, because of the problems in North Korea, we are seeing it on shaky ground.And -- and I just -- so I just have to make this general point that the Bush administration, some of Senator McCain\\'s own advisers all think this is important, and Senator McCain appears resistant.He even said the other day that he would not meet potentially with the prime minister of Spain, because he -- you know, he wasn\\'t sure whether they were aligned with us. I mean, Spain? Spain is a NATO ally.MCCAIN: Of course.OBAMA: If we can\\'t meet with our friends, I don\\'t know how we\\'re going to lead the world in terms of dealing with critical issues like terrorism.MCCAIN: I\\'m not going to set the White House visitors schedule before I\\'m president of the United States. I don\\'t even have a seal yet.Look, Dr. Kissinger did not say that he would approve of face-to- face meetings between the president of the United States and the president -- and Ahmadinejad. He did not say that.OBAMA: Of course not.MCCAIN: He said that there could be secretary-level and lower level meetings. I\\'ve always encouraged them. The Iranians have met with Ambassador Crocker in Baghdad.What Senator Obama doesn\\'t seem to understand that if without precondition you sit down across the table from someone who has called Israel a \"stinking corpse,\" and wants to destroy that country and wipe it off the map, you legitimize those comments.This is dangerous. It isn\\'t just naive; it\\'s dangerous. And so we just have a fundamental difference of opinion.As far as North Korea is concerned, our secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, went to North Korea. By the way, North Korea, most repressive and brutal regime probably on Earth. The average South Korean is three inches taller than the average North Korean, a huge gulag.We don\\'t know what the status of the dear leader\\'s health is today, but we know this, that the North Koreans have broken every agreement that they\\'ve entered into.And we ought to go back to a little bit of Ronald Reagan\\'s \"trust, but verify,\" and certainly not sit down across the table from -- without precondition, as Senator Obama said he did twice, I mean, it\\'s just dangerous.OBAMA: Look, I mean, Senator McCain keeps on using this example that suddenly the president would just meet with somebody without doing any preparation, without having low-level talks. Nobody\\'s been talking about that, and Senator McCain knows it. This is a mischaracterization of my position.When we talk about preconditions -- and Henry Kissinger did say we should have contacts without preconditions -- the idea is that we do not expect to solve every problem before we initiate talks.And, you know, the Bush administration has come to recognize that it hasn\\'t worked, this notion that we are simply silent when it comes to our enemies. And the notion that we would sit with Ahmadinejad and not say anything while he\\'s spewing his nonsense and his vile comments is ridiculous. Nobody is even talking about that.MCCAIN: So let me get this right. We sit down with Ahmadinejad, and he says, \"We\\'re going to wipe Israel off the face of the Earth,\" and we say, \"No, you\\'re not\"? Oh, please.OBAMA: No, let me tell...(CROSSTALK)MCCAIN: By the way, my friend, Dr. Kissinger, who\\'s been my friend for 35 years, would be interested to hear this conversation and Senator Obama\\'s depiction of his -- of his positions on the issue. I\\'ve known him for 35 years.OBAMA: We will take a look.MCCAIN: And I guarantee you he would not -- he would not say that presidential top level.OBAMA: Nobody\\'s talking about that.MCCAIN: Of course he encourages and other people encourage contacts, and negotiations, and all other things. We do that all the time.LEHRER: We\\'re going to go to a new...(CROSSTALK)MCCAIN: And Senator Obama is parsing words when he says precondition means preparation.OBAMA: I am not parsing words.MCCAIN: He\\'s parsing words, my friends.OBAMA: I\\'m using the same words that your advisers use.Please, go ahead.LEHRER: New lead question.Russia, goes to you, two minutes, Senator Obama. How do you see the relationship with Russia? Do you see them as a competitor? Do you see them as an enemy? Do you see them as a potential partner?OBAMA: Well, I think that, given what\\'s happened over the last several weeks and months, our entire Russian approach has to be evaluated, because a resurgent and very aggressive Russia is a threat to the peace and stability of the region.Their actions in Georgia were unacceptable. They were unwarranted. And at this point, it is absolutely critical for the next president to make clear that we have to follow through on our six-party -- or the six-point cease-fire. They have to remove themselves from South Ossetia and Abkhazia.It is absolutely important that we have a unified alliance and that we explain to the Russians that you cannot be a 21st-century superpower, or power, and act like a 20th-century dictatorship.And we also have to affirm all the fledgling democracies in that region, you know, the Estonians, the Lithuanians, the Latvians, the Poles, the Czechs, that we are, in fact, going to be supportive and in solidarity with them in their efforts. They are members of NATO.And to countries like Georgia and the Ukraine, I think we have to insist that they are free to join NATO if they meet the requirements, and they should have a membership action plan immediately to start bringing them in.Now, we also can\\'t return to a Cold War posture with respect to Russia. It\\'s important that we recognize there are going to be some areas of common interest. One is nuclear proliferation.They have not only 15,000 nuclear warheads, but they\\'ve got enough to make another 40,000, and some of those loose nukes could fall into the hands of Al Qaida.This is an area where I\\'ve led on in the Senate, working with a Republican ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Dick Lugar, to deal with the proliferation of loose nuclear weapons. That\\'s an area where we\\'re going to have to work with Russia.But we have to have a president who is clear that you don\\'t deal with Russia based on staring into his eyes and seeing his soul. You deal with Russia based on, what are your -- what are the national security interests of the United States of America?And we have to recognize that the way they\\'ve been behaving lately demands a sharp response from the international community and our allies.LEHRER: Two minutes on Russia, Senator McCain.MCCAIN: Well, I was interested in Senator Obama\\'s reaction to the Russian aggression against Georgia. His first statement was, \"Both sides ought to show restraint.\"Again, a little bit of naivete there. He doesn\\'t understand that Russia committed serious aggression against Georgia. And Russia has now become a nation fueled by petro-dollars that is basically a KGB apparatchik-run government.I looked into Mr. Putin\\'s eyes, and I saw three letters, a \"K,\" a \"G,\" and a \"B.\" And their aggression in Georgia is not acceptable behavior.I don\\'t believe we\\'re going to go back to the Cold War. I am sure that that will not happen. But I do believe that we need to bolster our friends and allies. And that wasn\\'t just about a problem between Georgia and Russia. It had everything to do with energy.There\\'s a pipeline that runs from the Caspian through Georgia through Turkey. And, of course, we know that the Russians control other sources of energy into Europe, which they have used from time to time.It\\'s not accidental that the presidents of Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania, Poland, and Ukraine flew to Georgia, flew to Tbilisi, where I have spent significant amount of time with a great young president, Misha Saakashvili.MCCAIN: And they showed solidarity with them, but, also, they are very concerned about the Russian threats to regain their status of the old Russian to regain their status of the old Russian empire.Now, I think the Russians ought to understand that we will support -- we, the United States -- will support the inclusion of Georgia and Ukraine in the natural process, inclusion into NATO.We also ought to make it very clear that the Russians are in violation of their cease-fire agreement. They have stationed additional troops in Abkhazia and South Ossetia.By the way, I went there once, and we went inside and drove in, and there was a huge poster. And this is -- this is Georgian territory. And there was a huge poster of Vladimir Putin, and it said, \"Vladimir Putin, our president.\"It was very clear, the Russian intentions towards Georgia. They were just waiting to seize the opportunity.So, this is a very difficult situation. We want to work with the Russians. But we also have every right to expect the Russians to behave in a fashion and keeping with a -- with a -- with a country who respects international boundaries and the norms of international behavior.And watch Ukraine. This whole thing has got a lot to do with Ukraine, Crimea, the base of the Russian fleet in Sevastopol. And the breakdown of the political process in Ukraine between Tymoshenko and Yushchenko is a very serious problem.So watch Ukraine, and let\\'s make sure that we -- that the Ukrainians understand that we are their friend and ally.LEHRER: You see any -- do you have a major difference with what he just said?OBAMA: No, actually, I think Senator McCain and I agree for the most part on these issues. Obviously, I disagree with this notion that somehow we did not forcefully object to Russians going into Georgia.I immediately said that this was illegal and objectionable. And, absolutely, I wanted a cessation of the violence, because it put an enormous strain on Georgia, and that\\'s why I was the first to say that we have to rebuild the Georgian economy and called for a billion dollars that has now gone in to help them rebuild.Because part of Russia\\'s intentions here was to weaken the economy to the point where President Saakashvili was so weakened that he might be replaced by somebody that Putin favored more.Two points I think are important to think about when it comes to Russia.Number one is we have to have foresight and anticipate some of these problems. So back in April, I warned the administration that you had Russian peacekeepers in Georgian territory. That made no sense whatsoever.And what we needed to do was replace them with international peacekeepers and a special envoy to resolve the crisis before it boiled over.That wasn\\'t done. But had it been done, it\\'s possible we could have avoided the issue.The second point I want to make is -- is the issue of energy. Russia is in part resurgent and Putin is feeling powerful because of petro-dollars, as Senator McCain mentioned.That means that we, as one of the biggest consumers of oil -- 25 percent of the world\\'s oil -- have to have an energy strategy not just to deal with Russia, but to deal with many of the rogue states we\\'ve talked about, Iran, Venezuela.And that means, yes, increasing domestic production and off-shore drilling, but we only have 3 percent of the world\\'s oil supplies and we use 25 percent of the world\\'s oil. So we can\\'t simply drill our way out of the problem.What we\\'re going to have to do is to approach it through alternative energy, like solar, and wind, and biodiesel, and, yes, nuclear energy, clean-coal technology. And, you know, I\\'ve got a plan for us to make a significant investment over the next 10 years to do that.And I have to say, Senator McCain and I, I think agree on the importance of energy, but Senator McCain mentioned earlier the importance of looking at a record.Over 26 years, Senator McCain voted 23 times against alternative energy, like solar, and wind, and biodiesel.And so we -- we -- we\\'ve got to walk the walk and not just talk the talk when it comes to energy independence, because this is probably going to be just as vital for our economy and the pain that people are feeling at the pump -- and, you know, winter\\'s coming and home heating oil -- as it is our national security and the issue of climate change that\\'s so important.LEHRER: We\\'ve got time for one more lead question segment. We\\'re way out of...(CROSSTALK)LEHRER: Quick response and then...(CROSSTALK)MCCAIN: No one from Arizona is against solar. And Senator Obama says he\\'s for nuclear, but he\\'s against reprocessing and he\\'s against storing. So...OBAMA: That\\'s just not true, John. John, I\\'m sorry, but that\\'s not true.MCCAIN: ... it\\'s hard to get there from here. And off-shore drilling is also something that is very important and it is a bridge.And we know that, if we drill off-shore and exploit a lot of these reserves, it will help, at temporarily, relieve our energy requirements. And it will have, I think, an important effect on the price of a barrel of oil.OBAMA: I just have to respond very quickly, just to correct -- just to correct the record.MCCAIN: So I want to say that, with the Nunn-Lugar thing...LEHRER: Excuse me, Senator.OBAMA: John?MCCAIN: ... I supported Nunn-Lugar back in the early 1990s when a lot of my colleagues didn\\'t. That was the key legislation at the time and put us on the road to eliminating this issue of nuclear waste and the nuclear fuel that has to be taken care of.OBAMA: I -- I just have to correct the record here. I have never said that I object to nuclear waste. What I\\'ve said is that we have to store it safely.And, Senator McCain, he says -- he talks about Arizona.LEHRER: All right.OBAMA: I\\'ve got to make this point, Jim.LEHRER: OK.OBAMA: He objects...MCCAIN: I have voted for alternate fuel all of my time...OBAMA: He -- he -- he objects...(CROSSTALK)LEHRER: One at a time, please.OBAMA: He objected...LEHRER: One at a time.MCCAIN: No one can be opposed to alternate energy.OBAMA: All right, fair enough. Let\\'s move on. You\\'ve got one more energy -- you\\'ve got one more question.LEHRER: This is the last -- last lead question. You have two minutes each. And the question is this, beginning with you, Senator McCain.What do you think the likelihood is that there would be another 9/11-type attack on the continental United States?MCCAIN: I think it\\'s much less than it was the day after 9/11. I think it -- that we have a safer nation, but we are a long way from safe.And I want to tell you that one of the things I\\'m most proud of, among others, because I have worked across the aisle. I have a long record on that, on a long series of reforms.But after 9/11, Senator Joe Lieberman and I decided that we needed a commission, and that was a commission to investigate 9/11, and find out what happened, and fix it.And we were -- we were opposed by the administration, another area where I differed with this administration. And we were stymied until the families of 9/11 came, and they descended on Washington, and we got that legislation passed.And there were a series of recommendations, as I recall, more than 40. And I\\'m happy to say that we\\'ve gotten written into law most of those reforms recommended by that commission. I\\'m proud of that work, again, bipartisan, reaching across the aisle, working together, Democrat and Republican alike.So we have a long way to go in our intelligence services. We have to do a better job in human intelligence. And we\\'ve got to -- to make sure that we have people who are trained interrogators so that we don\\'t ever torture a prisoner ever again.We have to make sure that our technological and intelligence capabilities are better. We have to work more closely with our allies. I know our allies, and I can work much more closely with them.But I can tell you that I think America is safer today than it was on 9/11. But that doesn\\'t mean that we don\\'t have a long way to go.And I\\'d like to remind you, also, as a result of those recommendations, we\\'ve probably had the largest reorganization of government since we established the Defense Department. And I think that those men and women in those agencies are doing a great job.But we still have a long way to go before we can declare America safe, and that means doing a better job along our borders, as well.LEHRER: Two minutes, Senator Obama.OBAMA: Well, first of all, I think that we are safer in some ways. Obviously, we\\'ve poured billions of dollars into airport security. We have done some work in terms of securing potential targets, but we still have a long way to go.We\\'ve got to make sure that we\\'re hardening our chemical sites. We haven\\'t done enough in terms of transit; we haven\\'t done enough in terms of ports.And the biggest threat that we face right now is not a nuclear missile coming over the skies. It\\'s in a suitcase.This is why the issue of nuclear proliferation is so important. It is the -- the biggest threat to the United States is a terrorist getting their hands on nuclear weapons.And we -- we are spending billions of dollars on missile defense. And I actually believe that we need missile defense, because of Iran and North Korea and the potential for them to obtain or to launch nuclear weapons, but I also believe that, when we are only spending a few hundred million dollars on nuclear proliferation, then we\\'re making a mistake.The other thing that we have to focus on, though, is Al Qaida. They are now operating in 60 countries. We can\\'t simply be focused on Iraq. We have to go to the root cause, and that is in Afghanistan and Pakistan. That\\'s going to be critical. We are going to need more cooperation with our allies.And one last point I want to make. It is important for us to understand that the way we are perceived in the world is going to make a difference, in terms of our capacity to get cooperation and root out terrorism.And one of the things that I intend to do as president is to restore America\\'s standing in the world. We are less respected now than we were eight years ago or even four years ago.OBAMA: And this is the greatest country on Earth. But because of some of the mistakes that have been made -- and I give Senator McCain great credit on the torture issue, for having identified that as something that undermines our long-term security -- because of those things, we, I think, are going to have a lot of work to do in the next administration to restore that sense that America is that shining beacon on a hill.LEHRER: Do you agree there\\'s much to be done in a new administration to restore...(CROSSTALK)MCCAIN: But in the case of missile defense, Senator Obama said it had to be, quote, \"proven.\" That wasn\\'t proven when Ronald Reagan said we would do SDI, which is missile defense. And it was major -- a major factor in bringing about the end of the Cold War.We seem to come full circle again. Senator Obama still doesn\\'t quite understand -- or doesn\\'t get it -- that if we fail in Iraq, it encourages Al Qaida. They would establish a base in Iraq.The consequences of defeat, which would result from his plan of withdrawal and according to date certain, regardless of conditions, according to our military leaders, according to every expert, would lead to defeat -- possible defeat, loss of all the fragile sacrifice that we\\'ve made of American blood and treasure, which grieves us all.All of that would be lost if we followed Senator Obama\\'s plan to have specific dates with withdrawal, regardless of conditions on the ground.And General Petraeus says we have had great success, but it\\'s very fragile. And we can\\'t do what Senator Obama wants to do.That is the central issue of our time. And I think Americans will judge very seriously as to whether that\\'s the right path or the wrong path and who should be the next president of the United States.LEHRER: You see the same connections that Senator McCain does?OBAMA: Oh, there\\'s no doubt. Look, over the last eight years, this administration, along with Senator McCain, have been solely focused on Iraq. That has been their priority. That has been where all our resources have gone.In the meantime, bin Laden is still out there. He is not captured. He is not killed. Al Qaida is resurgent.In the meantime, we\\'ve got challenges, for example, with China, where we are borrowing billions of dollars. They now hold a trillion dollars\\' worth of our debt. And they are active in countries like -- in regions like Latin America, and Asia, and Africa. They are -- the conspicuousness of their presence is only matched by our absence, because we\\'ve been focused on Iraq.We have weakened our capacity to project power around the world because we have viewed everything through this single lens, not to mention, look at our economy. We are now spending $10 billion or more every month.And that means we can\\'t provide health care to people who need it. We can\\'t invest in science and technology, which will determine whether or not we are going to be competitive in the long term.There has never been a country on Earth that saw its economy decline and yet maintained its military superiority. So this is a national security issue.We haven\\'t adequately funded veterans\\' care. I sit on the Veterans Affairs Committee, and we\\'ve got -- I meet veterans all across the country who are trying to figure out, \"How can I get disability payments? I\\'ve got post-traumatic stress disorder, and yet I can\\'t get treatment.\"So we have put all chips in, right there, and nobody is talking about losing this war. What we are talking about is recognizing that the next president has to have a broader strategic vision about all the challenges that we face.That\\'s been missing over the last eight years. That sense is something that I want to restore.MCCAIN: I\\'ve been involved, as I mentioned to you before, in virtually every major national security challenge we\\'ve faced in the last 20-some years. There are some advantages to experience, and knowledge, and judgment.And I -- and I honestly don\\'t believe that Senator Obama has the knowledge or experience and has made the wrong judgments in a number of areas, including his initial reaction to Russian invasion -- aggression in Georgia, to his -- you know, we\\'ve seen this stubbornness before in this administration to cling to a belief that somehow the surge has not succeeded and failing to acknowledge that he was wrong about the surge is -- shows to me that we -- that -- that we need more flexibility in a president of the United States than that.As far as our other issues that he brought up are concerned, I know the veterans. I know them well. And I know that they know that I\\'ll take care of them. And I\\'ve been proud of their support and their recognition of my service to the veterans.And I love them. And I\\'ll take care of them. And they know that I\\'ll take care of them. And that\\'s going to be my job.But, also, I have the ability, and the knowledge, and the background to make the right judgments, to keep this country safe and secure.Reform, prosperity, and peace, these are major challenges to the United States of America. I don\\'t think I need any on-the-job training. I\\'m ready to go at it right now.OBAMA: Well, let me just make a closing point. You know, my father came from Kenya. That\\'s where I get my name.And in the \\'60s, he wrote letter after letter to come to college here in the United States because the notion was that there was no other country on Earth where you could make it if you tried. The ideals and the values of the United States inspired the entire world.I don\\'t think any of us can say that our standing in the world now, the way children around the world look at the United States, is the same.And part of what we need to do, what the next president has to do -- and this is part of our judgment, this is part of how we\\'re going to keep America safe -- is to -- to send a message to the world that we are going to invest in issues like education, we are going to invest in issues that -- that relate to how ordinary people are able to live out their dreams.And that is something that I\\'m going to be committed to as president of the United States.LEHRER: Few seconds. We\\'re almost finished.MCCAIN: Jim, when I came home from prison, I saw our veterans being very badly treated, and it made me sad. And I embarked on an effort to resolve the POW-MIA issue, which we did in a bipartisan fashion, and then I worked on normalization of relations between our two countries so that our veterans could come all the way home.I guarantee you, as president of the United States, I know how to heal the wounds of war, I know how to deal with our adversaries, and I know how to deal with our friends.LEHRER: And that ends this debate tonight.On October 2nd, next Thursday, also at 9:00 p.m. Eastern time, the two vice presidential candidates will debate at Washington University in St. Louis. My PBS colleague, Gwen Ifill, will be the moderator.For now, from Oxford, Mississippi, thank you, senators, both. I\\'m Jim Lehrer.

I\\'m Jim Lehrer of the NewsHour on PBS, and I welcome you to the first of the 2008 presidential debates between the Republican nominee, Senator John McCain of Arizona, and the Democratic nominee, Senator Barack Obama of Illinois.The Commission on Presidential Debates is the sponsor of this event and the three other presidential and vice presidential debates coming in October.Tonight\\'s will primarily be about foreign policy and national security, which, by definition, includes the global financial crisis. It will be divided roughly into nine-minute segments.Direct exchanges between the candidates and moderator follow-ups are permitted after each candidate has two minutes to answer the lead question in an order determined by a coin toss.The specific subjects and questions were chosen by me. They have not been shared or cleared with anyone.The audience here in the hall has promised to remain silent, no cheers, no applause, no noise of any kind, except right now, as we welcome Senators Obama and McCain.(APPLAUSE)Let me begin with something General Eisenhower said in his 1952 presidential campaign. Quote, \"We must achieve both security and solvency. In fact, the foundation of military strength is economic strength,\" end quote.With that in mind, the first lead question.Gentlemen, at this very moment tonight, where do you stand on the financial recovery plan?First response to you, Senator Obama. You have two minutes.OBAMA: Well, thank you very much, Jim, and thanks to the commission and the University of Mississippi, Ole Miss, for hosting us tonight. I can\\'t think of a more important time for us to talk about the future of the country.You know, we are at a defining moment in our history. Our nation is involved in two wars, and we are going through the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.And although we\\'ve heard a lot about Wall Street, those of you on Main Street I think have been struggling for a while, and you recognize that this could have an impact on all sectors of the economy.And you\\'re wondering, how\\'s it going to affect me? How\\'s it going to affect my job? How\\'s it going to affect my house? How\\'s it going to affect my retirement savings or my ability to send my children to college?So we have to move swiftly, and we have to move wisely. And I\\'ve put forward a series of proposals that make sure that we protect taxpayers as we engage in this important rescue effort.Number one, we\\'ve got to make sure that we\\'ve got oversight over this whole process; $700 billion, potentially, is a lot of money.Number two, we\\'ve got to make sure that taxpayers, when they are putting their money at risk, have the possibility of getting that money back and gains, if the market -- and when the market returns.Number three, we\\'ve got to make sure that none of that money is going to pad CEO bank accounts or to promote golden parachutes.And, number four, we\\'ve got to make sure that we\\'re helping homeowners, because the root problem here has to do with the foreclosures that are taking place all across the country.Now, we also have to recognize that this is a final verdict on eight years of failed economic policies promoted by George Bush, supported by Senator McCain, a theory that basically says that we can shred regulations and consumer protections and give more and more to the most, and somehow prosperity will trickle down.It hasn\\'t worked. And I think that the fundamentals of the economy have to be measured by whether or not the middle class is getting a fair shake. That\\'s why I\\'m running for president, and that\\'s what I hope we\\'re going to be talking about tonight.LEHRER: Senator McCain, two minutes.MCCAIN: Well, thank you, Jim. And thanks to everybody.And I do have a sad note tonight. Senator Kennedy is in the hospital. He\\'s a dear and beloved friend to all of us. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the lion of the Senate.I also want to thank the University of Mississippi for hosting us tonight.And, Jim, I -- I\\'ve been not feeling too great about a lot of things lately. So have a lot of Americans who are facing challenges. But I\\'m feeling a little better tonight, and I\\'ll tell you why.Because as we\\'re here tonight in this debate, we are seeing, for the first time in a long time, Republicans and Democrats together, sitting down, trying to work out a solution to this fiscal crisis that we\\'re in.And have no doubt about the magnitude of this crisis. And we\\'re not talking about failure of institutions on Wall Street. We\\'re talking about failures on Main Street, and people who will lose their jobs, and their credits, and their homes, if we don\\'t fix the greatest fiscal crisis, probably in -- certainly in our time, and I\\'ve been around a little while.But the point is -- the point is, we have finally seen Republicans and Democrats sitting down and negotiating together and coming up with a package.This package has transparency in it. It has to have accountability and oversight. It has to have options for loans to failing businesses, rather than the government taking over those loans. We have to -- it has to have a package with a number of other essential elements to it.And, yes, I went back to Washington, and I met with my Republicans in the House of Representatives. And they weren\\'t part of the negotiations, and I understand that. And it was the House Republicans that decided that they would be part of the solution to this problem.But I want to emphasize one point to all Americans tonight. This isn\\'t the beginning of the end of this crisis. This is the end of the beginning, if we come out with a package that will keep these institutions stable.And we\\'ve got a lot of work to do. And we\\'ve got to create jobs. And one of the areas, of course, is to eliminate our dependence on foreign oil.LEHRER: All right, let\\'s go back to my question. How do you all stand on the recovery plan? And talk to each other about it. We\\'ve got five minutes. We can negotiate a deal right here.But, I mean, are you -- do you favor this plan, Senator Obama, and you, Senator McCain? Do you -- are you in favor of this plan?OBAMA: We haven\\'t seen the language yet. And I do think that there\\'s constructive work being done out there. So, for the viewers who are watching, I am optimistic about the capacity of us to come together with a plan.The question, I think, that we have to ask ourselves is, how did we get into this situation in the first place?Two years ago, I warned that, because of the subprime lending mess, because of the lax regulation, that we were potentially going to have a problem and tried to stop some of the abuses in mortgages that were taking place at the time.Last year, I wrote to the secretary of the Treasury to make sure that he understood the magnitude of this problem and to call on him to bring all the stakeholders together to try to deal with it.So -- so the question, I think, that we\\'ve got to ask ourselves is, yes, we\\'ve got to solve this problem short term. And we are going to have to intervene; there\\'s no doubt about that.But we\\'re also going to have to look at, how is it that we shredded so many regulations? We did not set up a 21st-century regulatory framework to deal with these problems. And that in part has to do with an economic philosophy that says that regulation is always bad.LEHRER: Are you going to vote for the plan, Senator McCain?MCCAIN: I -- I hope so. And I...LEHRER: As a United States senator...MCCAIN: Sure.LEHRER: ... you\\'re going to vote for the plan?MCCAIN: Sure. But -- but let me -- let me point out, I also warned about Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and warned about corporate greed and excess, and CEO pay, and all that. A lot of us saw this train wreck coming.But there\\'s also the issue of responsibility. You\\'ve mentioned President Dwight David Eisenhower. President Eisenhower, on the night before the Normandy invasion, went into his room, and he wrote out two letters.One of them was a letter congratulating the great members of the military and allies that had conducted and succeeded in the greatest invasion in history, still to this day, and forever.And he wrote out another letter, and that was a letter of resignation from the United States Army for the failure of the landings at Normandy.Somehow we\\'ve lost that accountability. I\\'ve been heavily criticized because I called for the resignation of the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. We\\'ve got to start also holding people accountable, and we\\'ve got to reward people who succeed.But somehow in Washington today -- and I\\'m afraid on Wall Street -- greed is rewarded, excess is rewarded, and corruption -- or certainly failure to carry out our responsibility is rewarded.As president of the United States, people are going to be held accountable in my administration. And I promise you that that will happen.LEHRER: Do you have something directly to say, Senator Obama, to Senator McCain about what he just said?OBAMA: Well, I think Senator McCain\\'s absolutely right that we need more responsibility, but we need it not just when there\\'s a crisis. I mean, we\\'ve had years in which the reigning economic ideology has been what\\'s good for Wall Street, but not what\\'s good for Main Street.And there are folks out there who\\'ve been struggling before this crisis took place. And that\\'s why it\\'s so important, as we solve this short-term problem, that we look at some of the underlying issues that have led to wages and incomes for ordinary Americans to go down, the -- a health care system that is broken, energy policies that are not working, because, you know, 10 days ago, John said that the fundamentals of the economy are sound.LEHRER: Say it directly to him.OBAMA: I do not think that they are.LEHRER: Say it directly to him.OBAMA: Well, the -- John, 10 days ago, you said that the fundamentals of the economy are sound. And...MCCAIN: Are you afraid I couldn\\'t hear him?(LAUGHTER)LEHRER: I\\'m just determined to get you all to talk to each other. I\\'m going to try.OBAMA: The -- and I just fundamentally disagree. And unless we are holding ourselves accountable day in, day out, not just when there\\'s a crisis for folks who have power and influence and can hire lobbyists, but for the nurse, the teacher, the police officer, who, frankly, at the end of each month, they\\'ve got a little financial crisis going on.They\\'re having to take out extra debt just to make their mortgage payments. We haven\\'t been paying attention to them. And if you look at our tax policies, it\\'s a classic example.LEHRER: So, Senator McCain, do you agree with what Senator Obama just said? And, if you don\\'t, tell him what you disagree with.MCCAIN: No, I -- look, we\\'ve got to fix the system. We\\'ve got fundamental problems in the system. And Main Street is paying a penalty for the excesses and greed in Washington, D.C., and in the Wall Street.So there\\'s no doubt that we have a long way to go. And, obviously, stricter interpretation and consolidation of the various regulatory agencies that weren\\'t doing their job, that has brought on this crisis.But I have a fundamental belief in the goodness and strength of the American worker. And the American worker is the most productive, the most innovative. America is still the greatest producer, exporter and importer.But we\\'ve got to get through these times, but I have a fundamental belief in the United States of America. And I still believe, under the right leadership, our best days are ahead of us.LEHRER: All right, let\\'s go to the next lead question, which is essentially following up on this same subject.And you get two minutes to begin with, Senator McCain. And using your word \"fundamental,\" are there fundamental differences between your approach and Senator Obama\\'s approach to what you would do as president to lead this country out of the financial crisis?MCCAIN: Well, the first thing we have to do is get spending under control in Washington. It\\'s completely out of control. It\\'s gone -- we have now presided over the largest increase in the size of government since the Great Society.We Republicans came to power to change government, and government changed us. And the -- the worst symptom on this disease is what my friend, Tom Coburn, calls earmarking as a gateway drug, because it\\'s a gateway. It\\'s a gateway to out-of-control spending and corruption.And we have former members of Congress now residing in federal prison because of the evils of this earmarking and pork-barrel spending.You know, we spent $3 million to study the DNA of bears in Montana. I don\\'t know if that was a criminal issue or a paternal issue, but the fact is that it was $3 million of our taxpayers\\' money. And it has got to be brought under control.As president of the United States, I want to assure you, I\\'ve got a pen. This one\\'s kind of old. I\\'ve got a pen, and I\\'m going to veto every single spending bill that comes across my desk. I will make them famous. You will know their names.Now, Senator Obama, you wanted to know one of the differences. He has asked for $932 million of earmark pork-barrel spending, nearly a million dollars for every day that he\\'s been in the United States Senate.I suggest that people go up on the Web site of Citizens Against Government Waste, and they\\'ll look at those projects.That kind of thing is not the way to rein in runaway spending in Washington, D.C. That\\'s one of the fundamental differences that Senator Obama and I have.LEHRER: Senator Obama, two minutes.OBAMA: Well, Senator McCain is absolutely right that the earmarks process has been abused, which is why I suspended any requests for my home state, whether it was for senior centers or what have you, until we cleaned it up.And he\\'s also right that oftentimes lobbyists and special interests are the ones that are introducing these kinds of requests, although that wasn\\'t the case with me.But let\\'s be clear: Earmarks account for $18 billion in last year\\'s budget. Senator McCain is proposing -- and this is a fundamental difference between us -- $300 billion in tax cuts to some of the wealthiest corporations and individuals in the country, $300 billion.Now, $18 billion is important; $300 billion is really important. And in his tax plan, you would have CEOs of Fortune 500 companies getting an average of $700,000 in reduced taxes, while leaving 100 million Americans out.So my attitude is, we\\'ve got to grow the economy from the bottom up. What I\\'ve called for is a tax cut for 95 percent of working families, 95 percent.And that means that the ordinary American out there who\\'s collecting a paycheck every day, they\\'ve got a little extra money to be able to buy a computer for their kid, to fill up on this gas that is killing them.And over time, that, I think, is going to be a better recipe for economic growth than the -- the policies of President Bush that John McCain wants to -- wants to follow.LEHRER: Senator McCain?MCCAIN: Well, again, I don\\'t mean to go back and forth, but he...(CROSSTALK)LEHRER: No, that\\'s fine.MCCAIN: Senator Obama suspended those requests for pork-barrel projects after he was running for president of the United States. He didn\\'t happen to see that light during the first three years as a member of the United States Senate, $932 million in requests.Maybe to Senator Obama it\\'s not a lot of money. But the point is that -- you see, I hear this all the time. \"It\\'s only $18 billion.\" Do you know that it\\'s tripled in the last five years? Do you know that it\\'s gone completely out of control to the point where it corrupts people? It corrupts people.That\\'s why we have, as I said, people under federal indictment and charges. It\\'s a system that\\'s got to be cleaned up.I have fought against it my career. I have fought against it. I was called the sheriff, by the -- one of the senior members of the Appropriations Committee. I didn\\'t win Miss Congeniality in the United States Senate.Now, Senator Obama didn\\'t mention that, along with his tax cuts, he is also proposing some $800 billion in new spending on new programs.Now, that\\'s a fundamental difference between myself and Senator Obama. I want to cut spending. I want to keep taxes low. The worst thing we could do in this economic climate is to raise people\\'s taxes.OBAMA: I -- I don\\'t know where John is getting his figures. Let\\'s just be clear.What I do is I close corporate loopholes, stop providing tax cuts to corporations that are shipping jobs overseas so that we\\'re giving tax breaks to companies that are investing here in the United States. I make sure that we have a health care system that allows for everyone to have basic coverage.I think those are pretty important priorities. And I pay for every dime of it.But let\\'s go back to the original point. John, nobody is denying that $18 billion is important. And, absolutely, we need earmark reform. And when I\\'m president, I will go line by line to make sure that we are not spending money unwisely.But the fact is that eliminating earmarks alone is not a recipe for how we\\'re going to get the middle class back on track.OBAMA: And when you look at your tax policies that are directed primarily at those who are doing well, and you are neglecting people who are really struggling right now, I think that is a continuation of the last eight years, and we can\\'t afford another four.LEHRER: Respond directly to him about that, to Senator Obama about that, about the -- he\\'s made it twice now, about your tax -- your policies about tax cuts.MCCAIN: Well -- well, let me give you an example of what Senator Obama finds objectionable, the business tax.Right now, in the United States of America, business pays the second-highest business taxes in the world, 35 percent. Ireland pays 11 percent.Now, if you\\'re a business person, and you can locate any place in the world, then, obviously, if you go to the country where it\\'s 11 percent tax versus 35 percent, you\\'re going to be able to create jobs, increase your business, make more investment, et cetera.I want to cut that business tax. I want to cut it so that businesses will remain in -- in the United States of America and create jobs.But, again, I want to return. It\\'s a lot more than $18 billion in pork-barrel spending. I can tell you, it\\'s rife. It\\'s throughout.The United States Senate will take up a continuing resolution tomorrow or the next day, sometime next week, with 2,000 -- 2,000 -- look at them, my friends. Look at them. You\\'ll be appalled.And Senator Obama is a recent convert, after requesting $932 million worth of pork-barrel spending projects.So the point is, I want people to have tax cuts. I want every family to have a $5,000 refundable tax credit so they can go out and purchase their own health care. I want to double the dividend from $3,500 to $7,000 for every dependent child in America.I know that the worst thing we could possibly do is to raise taxes on anybody, and a lot of people might be interested in Senator Obama\\'s definition of \"rich.\"LEHRER: Senator Obama, you have a question for Senator McCain on that?OBAMA: Well, let me just make a couple of points.LEHRER: All right.OBAMA: My definition -- here\\'s what I can tell the American people: 95 percent of you will get a tax cut. And if you make less than $250,000, less than a quarter-million dollars a year, then you will not see one dime\\'s worth of tax increase.Now, John mentioned the fact that business taxes on paper are high in this country, and he\\'s absolutely right. Here\\'s the problem: There are so many loopholes that have been written into the tax code, oftentimes with support of Senator McCain, that we actually see our businesses pay effectively one of the lowest tax rates in the world.And what that means, then, is that there are people out there who are working every day, who are not getting a tax cut, and you want to give them more.It\\'s not like you want to close the loopholes. You just want to add an additional tax cut over the loopholes. And that\\'s a problem.Just one last point I want to make, since Senator McCain talked about providing a $5,000 health credit. Now, what he doesn\\'t tell you is that he intends to, for the first time in history, tax health benefits.So you may end up getting a $5,000 tax credit. Here\\'s the only problem: Your employer now has to pay taxes on the health care that you\\'re getting from your employer. And if you end up losing your health care from your employer, you\\'ve got to go out on the open market and try to buy it.It is not a good deal for the American people. But it\\'s an example of this notion that the market can always solve everything and that the less regulation we have, the better off we\\'re going to be.MCCAIN: Well, you know, let me just...LEHRER: We\\'ve got to go to another lead question.MCCAIN: I know we have to, but this is a classic example of walking the walk and talking the talk.We had an energy bill before the United States Senate. It was festooned with Christmas tree ornaments. It had all kinds of breaks for the oil companies, I mean, billions of dollars worth. I voted against it; Senator Obama voted for it.OBAMA: John, you want to give oil companies another $4 billion.MCCAIN: You\\'ve got to look at our record. You\\'ve got to look at our records. That\\'s the important thing.Who fought against wasteful and earmark spending? Who has been the person who has tried to keep spending under control?Who\\'s the person who has believed that the best thing for America is -- is to have a tax system that is fundamentally fair? And I\\'ve fought to simplify it, and I have proposals to simplify it.Let\\'s give every American a choice: two tax brackets, generous dividends, and, two -- and let Americans choose whether they want the -- the existing tax code or they want a new tax code.And so, again, look at the record, particularly the energy bill. But, again, Senator Obama has shifted on a number of occasions. He has voted in the United States Senate to increase taxes on people who make as low as $42,000 a year.OBAMA: That\\'s not true, John. That\\'s not true.MCCAIN: And that\\'s just a fact. Again, you can look it up.OBAMA: Look, it\\'s just not true. And if we want to talk about oil company profits, under your tax plan, John -- this is undeniable -- oil companies would get an additional $4 billion in tax breaks.Now, look, we all would love to lower taxes on everybody. But here\\'s the problem: If we are giving them to oil companies, then that means that there are those who are not going to be getting them. And...MCCAIN: With all due respect, you already gave them to the oil companies.OBAMA: No, but, John, the fact of the matter is, is that I was opposed to those tax breaks, tried to strip them out. We\\'ve got an energy bill on the Senate floor right now that contains some good stuff, some stuff you want, including drilling off-shore, but you\\'re opposed to it because it would strip away those tax breaks that have gone to oil companies.LEHRER: All right. All right, speaking of things that both of you want, another lead question, and it has to do with the rescue -- the financial rescue thing that we started -- started asking about.And what -- and the first answer is to you, Senator Obama. As president, as a result of whatever financial rescue plan comes about and the billion, $700 billion, whatever it is it\\'s going to cost, what are you going to have to give up, in terms of the priorities that you would bring as president of the United States, as a result of having to pay for the financial rescue plan?OBAMA: Well, there are a range of things that are probably going to have to be delayed. We don\\'t yet know what our tax revenues are going to be. The economy is slowing down, so it\\'s hard to anticipate right now what the budget is going to look like next year.But there\\'s no doubt that we\\'re not going to be able to do everything that I think needs to be done. There are some things that I think have to be done.We have to have energy independence, so I\\'ve put forward a plan to make sure that, in 10 years\\' time, we have freed ourselves from dependence on Middle Eastern oil by increasing production at home, but most importantly by starting to invest in alternative energy, solar, wind, biodiesel, making sure that we\\'re developing the fuel-efficient cars of the future right here in the United States, in Ohio and Michigan, instead of Japan and South Korea.We have to fix our health care system, which is putting an enormous burden on families. Just -- a report just came out that the average deductible went up 30 percent on American families.They are getting crushed, and many of them are going bankrupt as a consequence of health care. I\\'m meeting folks all over the country. We have to do that now, because it will actually make our businesses and our families better off.The third thing we have to do is we\\'ve got to make sure that we\\'re competing in education. We\\'ve got to invest in science and technology. China had a space launch and a space walk. We\\'ve got to make sure that our children are keeping pace in math and in science.And one of the things I think we have to do is make sure that college is affordable for every young person in America.And I also think that we\\'re going to have to rebuild our infrastructure, which is falling behind, our roads, our bridges, but also broadband lines that reach into rural communities.Also, making sure that we have a new electricity grid to get the alternative energy to population centers that are using them.So there are some -- some things that we\\'ve got to do structurally to make sure that we can compete in this global economy. We can\\'t shortchange those things. We\\'ve got to eliminate programs that don\\'t work, and we\\'ve got to make sure that the programs that we do have are more efficient and cost less.LEHRER: Are you -- what priorities would you adjust, as president, Senator McCain, because of the -- because of the financial bailout cost?MCCAIN: Look, we, no matter what, we\\'ve got to cut spending. We have -- as I said, we\\'ve let government get completely out of control.Senator Obama has the most liberal voting record in the United States Senate. It\\'s hard to reach across the aisle from that far to the left.The point -- the point is -- the point is, we need to examine every agency of government.First of all, by the way, I\\'d eliminate ethanol subsidies. I oppose ethanol subsidies.I think that we have to return -- particularly in defense spending, which is the largest part of our appropriations -- we have to do away with cost-plus contracts. We now have defense systems that the costs are completely out of control.We tried to build a little ship called the Littoral Combat Ship that was supposed to cost $140 million, ended up costing $400 million, and we still haven\\'t done it.So we need to have fixed-cost contracts. We need very badly to understand that defense spending is very important and vital, particularly in the new challenges we face in the world, but we have to get a lot of the cost overruns under control.I know how to do that.MCCAIN: I saved the taxpayers $6.8 billion by fighting a contract that was negotiated between Boeing and DOD that was completely wrong. And we fixed it and we killed it and the people ended up in federal prison so I know how to do this because I\\'ve been involved these issues for many, many years. But I think that we have to examine every agency of government and find out those that are doing their job and keep them and find out those that aren\\'t and eliminate them and we\\'ll have to scrub every agency of government.LEHRER: But if I hear the two of you correctly neither one of you is suggesting any major changes in what you want to do as president as a result of the financial bailout? Is that what you\\'re saying?OBAMA: No. As I said before, Jim, there are going to be things that end up having to be ...LEHRER: Like what?OBAMA: ... deferred and delayed. Well, look, I want to make sure that we are investing in energy in order to free ourselves from the dependence on foreign oil. That is a big project. That is a multi-year project.LEHRER: Not willing to give that up?OBAMA: Not willing to give up the need to do it but there may be individual components that we can\\'t do. But John is right we have to make cuts. We right now give $15 billion every year as subsidies to private insurers under the Medicare system. Doesn\\'t work any better through the private insurers. They just skim off $15 billion. That was a give away and part of the reason is because lobbyists are able to shape how Medicare works.They did it on the Medicaid prescription drug bill and we have to change the culture. Tom -- or John mentioned me being wildly liberal. Mostly that\\'s just me opposing George Bush\\'s wrong headed policies since I\\'ve been in Congress but I think it is that it is also important to recognize I worked with Tom Coburn, the most conservative, one of the most conservative Republicans who John already mentioned to set up what we call a Google for government saying we\\'ll list every dollar of federal spending to make sure that the taxpayer can take a look and see who, in fact, is promoting some of these spending projects that John\\'s been railing about.LEHRER: What I\\'m trying to get at this is this. Excuse me if I may, senator. Trying to get at that you all -- one of you is going to be the president of the United States come January. At the -- in the middle of a huge financial crisis that is yet to be resolved. And what I\\'m trying to get at is how this is going to affect you not in very specific -- small ways but in major ways and the approach to take as to the presidency.MCCAIN: How about a spending freeze on everything but defense, veteran affairs and entitlement programs.LEHRER: Spending freeze?MCCAIN: I think we ought to seriously consider with the exceptions of caring for our veterans national defense and several other vital issues.LEHRER: Would you go for that?OBAMA: The problem with a spending freeze is you\\'re using a hatchet where you need a scalpel. There are some programs that are very important that are under funded. I went to increase early childhood education and the notion that we should freeze that when there may be, for example, this Medicare subsidy, I think, doesn\\'t make sense.Let me tell you another place to look for some savings. We are currently spending $10 billion a month in Iraq when they have a $79 billion surplus. It seems to me that if we\\'re going to be strong at home as well as strong abroad, that we have to look at bringing that war to a close.MCCAIN: Look, we are sending $700 billion a year overseas to countries that don\\'t like us very much. Some of that money ends up in the hands of terrorist organizations. We have to have wind, tide, solar, natural gas, flex fuel cars and all that but we also have to have offshore drilling and we also have to have nuclear power.Senator Obama opposes both storing and reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel. You can\\'t get there from here and the fact is that we can create 700,000 jobs by building constructing 45 new nuclear power plants by the year 2030. Nuclear power is not only important as far as eliminating our dependence on foreign oil but it\\'s also responsibility as far as climate change is concerned. An issue I have been involved in for many, many years and I\\'m proud of the work of the work that I\\'ve done there along with Senator Clinton.LEHRER: Before we go to another lead question. Let me figure out a way to ask the same question in a slightly different way here. Are you -- are you willing to acknowledge both of you that this financial crisis is going to affect the way you rule the country as president of the United States beyond the kinds of things that you have already -- I mean, is it a major move? Is it going to have a major affect?OBAMA: There\\'s no doubt itâ€™s gonna affect our budgets. There is no doubt about it. Not only -- Even if we get all $700 billion back, let\\'s assume the markets recover, we\\'re holding assets long enough that eventually taxpayers get it back and that happened during the Great Depression when Roosevelt purchased a whole bunch of homes, over time, home values went back up and in fact government made a profit. If we\\'re lucky and we do it right, that could potentially happen but in the short term there\\'s an outlay and we may not see that money for a while.And because of the economy\\'s slowing down, I think we can also expect less tax revenue so there\\'s no doubt that as president I\\'m going to have to make some tough decision.The only point I want to make is this, that in order to make those tough decisions we have to know what our values are and who we\\'re fighting for and what our priorities are and if we are spending $300 billion on tax cuts for people who don\\'t need them and weren\\'t even asking for them, and we are leaving out health care which is crushing on people all across the country, then I think we have made a bad decision and I want to make sure we\\'re not shortchanging our long term priorities.MCCAIN: Well, I want to make sure we\\'re not handing the health care system over to the federal government which is basically what would ultimately happen with Senator Obama\\'s health care plan. I want the families to make decisions between themselves and their doctors. Not the federal government. Look. We have to obviously cut spending. I have fought to cut spending. Senator Obama has $800 billion in new spending programs. I would suggest he start by canceling some of those new spending program that he has.We can\\'t I think adjust spending around to take care of the very much needed programs, including taking care of our veterans but I also want to say again a healthy economy with low taxes would not raising anyone\\'s taxes is probably the best recipe for eventually having our economy recover.And spending restraint has got to be a vital part of that. And the reason, one of the major reasons why we\\'re in the difficulties we are in today is because spending got out of control. We owe China $500 billion. And spending, I know, can be brought under control because I have fought against excessive spending my entire career. And I got plans to reduce and eliminate unnecessary and wasteful spending and if there\\'s anybody here who thinks there aren\\'t agencies of government where spending can be cut and their budgets slashed they have not spent a lot of time in Washington.OBAMA: I just want to make this point, Jim. John, it\\'s been your president who you said you agreed with 90 percent of the time who presided over this increase in spending. This orgy of spending and enormous deficits you voted for almost all of his budgets. So to stand here and after eight years and say that you\\'re going to lead on controlling spending and, you know, balancing our tax cuts so that they help middle class families when over the last eight years that hasn\\'t happened I think just is, you know, kind of hard to swallow.LEHRER: Quick response to Senator Obama.MCCAIN: It\\'s well-known that I have not been elected Miss Congeniality in the United States Senate nor with the administration. I have opposed the president on spending, on climate change, on torture of prisoner, on - on Guantanamo Bay. On a -- on the way that the Iraq War was conducted. I have a long record and the American people know me very well and that is independent and a maverick of the Senate and I\\'m happy to say that I\\'ve got a partner that\\'s a good maverick along with me now.LEHRER: All right. Let\\'s go another subject. Lead question, two minutes to you, senator McCain. Much has been said about the lessons of Vietnam. What do you see as the lessons of Iraq?MCCAIN: I think the lessons of Iraq are very clear that you cannot have a failed strategy that will then cause you to nearly lose a conflict. Our initial military success, we went in to Baghdad and everybody celebrated. And then the war was very badly mishandled. I went to Iraq in 2003 and came back and said, we\\'ve got to change this strategy. This strategy requires additional troops, it requires a fundamental change in strategy and I fought for it. And finally, we came up with a great general and a strategy that has succeeded.This strategy has succeeded. And we are winning in Iraq. And we will come home with victory and with honor. And that withdrawal is the result of every counterinsurgency that succeeds.MCCAIN: And I want to tell you that now that we will succeed and our troops will come home, and not in defeat, that we will see a stable ally in the region and a fledgling democracy.The consequences of defeat would have been increased Iranian influence. It would have been increase in sectarian violence. It would have been a wider war, which the United States of America might have had to come back.So there was a lot at stake there. And thanks to this great general, David Petraeus, and the troops who serve under him, they have succeeded. And we are winning in Iraq, and we will come home. And we will come home as we have when we have won other wars and not in defeat.LEHRER: Two minutes, how you see the lessons of Iraq, Senator Obama.OBAMA: Well, this is an area where Senator McCain and I have a fundamental difference because I think the first question is whether we should have gone into the war in the first place.Now six years ago, I stood up and opposed this war at a time when it was politically risky to do so because I said that not only did we not know how much it was going to cost, what our exit strategy might be, how it would affect our relationships around the world, and whether our intelligence was sound, but also because we hadn\\'t finished the job in Afghanistan.We hadn\\'t caught bin Laden. We hadn\\'t put al Qaeda to rest, and as a consequence, I thought that it was going to be a distraction. Now Senator McCain and President Bush had a very different judgment.And I wish I had been wrong for the sake of the country and they had been right, but that\\'s not the case. We\\'ve spent over $600 billion so far, soon to be $1 trillion. We have lost over 4,000 lives. We have seen 30,000 wounded, and most importantly, from a strategic national security perspective, al Qaeda is resurgent, stronger now than at any time since 2001.We took our eye off the ball. And not to mention that we are still spending $10 billion a month, when they have a $79 billion surplus, at a time when we are in great distress here at home, and we just talked about the fact that our budget is way overstretched and we are borrowing money from overseas to try to finance just some of the basic functions of our government.So I think the lesson to be drawn is that we should never hesitate to use military force, and I will not, as president, in order to keep the American people safe. But we have to use our military wisely. And we did not use our military wisely in Iraq.LEHRER: Do you agree with that, the lesson of Iraq?MCCAIN: The next president of the United States is not going to have to address the issue as to whether we went into Iraq or not. The next president of the United States is going to have to decide how we leave, when we leave, and what we leave behind. That\\'s the decision of the next president of the United States.Senator Obama said the surge could not work, said it would increase sectarian violence, said it was doomed to failure. Recently on a television program, he said it exceed our wildest expectations.But yet, after conceding that, he still says that he would oppose the surge if he had to decide that again today. Incredibly, incredibly Senator Obama didn\\'t go to Iraq for 900 days and never asked for a meeting with General Petraeus.LEHRER: Well, let\\'s go at some of these things...MCCAIN: Senator Obama is the chairperson of a committee that oversights NATO that\\'s in Afghanistan. To this day, he has never had a hearing.LEHRER: What about that point?MCCAIN: I mean, it\\'s remarkable.LEHRER: All right. What about that point?OBAMA: Which point? He raised a whole bunch of them.LEHRER: I know, OK, let\\'s go to the latter point and we\\'ll back up. The point about your not having been...OBAMA: Look, I\\'m very proud of my vice presidential selection, Joe Biden, who is the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and as he explains, and as John well knows, the issues of Afghanistan, the issues of Iraq, critical issues like that, don\\'t go through my subcommittee because they\\'re done as a committee as a whole.But that\\'s Senate inside baseball. But let\\'s get back to the core issue here. Senator McCain is absolutely right that the violence has been reduced as a consequence of the extraordinary sacrifice of our troops and our military families.They have done a brilliant job, and General Petraeus has done a brilliant job. But understand, that was a tactic designed to contain the damage of the previous four years of mismanagement of this war.And so John likes -- John, you like to pretend like the war started in 2007. You talk about the surge. The war started in 2003, and at the time when the war started, you said it was going to be quick and easy. You said we knew where the weapons of mass destruction were. You were wrong.You said that we were going to be greeted as liberators. You were wrong. You said that there was no history of violence between Shia and Sunni. And you were wrong. And so my question is...(CROSSTALK)LEHRER: Senator Obama...OBAMA: ... of judgment, of whether or not -- of whether or not -- if the question is who is best-equipped as the next president to make good decisions about how we use our military, how we make sure that we are prepared and ready for the next conflict, then I think we can take a look at our judgment.LEHRER: I have got a lot on the plate here...MCCAIN: I\\'m afraid Senator Obama doesn\\'t understand the difference between a tactic and a strategy. But the important -- I\\'d like to tell you, two Fourths of July ago I was in Baghdad. General Petraeus invited Senator Lindsey Graham and me to attend a ceremony where 688 brave young Americans, whose enlistment had expired, were reenlisting to stay and fight for Iraqi freedom and American freedom.I was honored to be there. I was honored to speak to those troops. And you know, afterwards, we spent a lot of time with them. And you know what they said to us? They said, let us win. They said, let us win. We don\\'t want our kids coming back here.And this strategy, and this general, they are winning. Senator Obama refuses to acknowledge that we are winning in Iraq.OBAMA: That\\'s not true.MCCAIN: They just passed an electoral...OBAMA: That\\'s not true.MCCAIN: An election law just in the last few days. There is social, economic progress, and a strategy, a strategy of going into an area, clearing and holding, and the people of the country then become allied with you. They inform on the bad guys. And peace comes to the country, and prosperity.That\\'s what\\'s happening in Iraq, and it wasn\\'t a tactic.LEHRER: Let me see...OBAMA: Jim, Jim, this is a big...MCCAIN: It was a strategy. And that same strategy will be employed in Afghanistan by this great general. And Senator Obama, who after promising not to vote to cut off funds for the troops, did the incredible thing of voting to cut off the funds for the troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.OBAMA: Jim, there are a whole bunch of things we have got to answer. First of all, let\\'s talk about this troop funding issue because John always brings this up. Senator McCain cut -- Senator McCain opposed funding for troops in legislation that had a timetable, because he didn\\'t believe in a timetable.I opposed funding a mission that had no timetable, and was open- ended, giving a blank check to George Bush. We had a difference on the timetable. We didn\\'t have a difference on whether or not we were going to be funding troops.We had a legitimate difference, and I absolutely understand the difference between tactics and strategy. And the strategic question that the president has to ask is not whether or not we are employing a particular approach in the country once we have made the decision to be there.The question is, was this wise? We have seen Afghanistan worsen, deteriorate. We need more troops there. We need more resources there. Senator McCain, in the rush to go into Iraq, said, you know what? We\\'ve been successful in Afghanistan. There is nobody who can pose a threat to us there.This is a time when bin Laden was still out, and now they\\'ve reconstituted themselves. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates himself acknowledges the war on terrorism started in Afghanistan and it needs to end there.But we can\\'t do it if we are not willing to give Iraq back its country. Now, what I\\'ve said is we should end this war responsibly. We should do it in phases. But in 16 months we should be able to reduce our combat troops, put -- provide some relief to military families and our troops and bolster our efforts in Afghanistan so that we can capture and kill bin Laden and crush al Qaeda.And right now, the commanders in Afghanistan, as well as Admiral Mullen, have acknowledged that we don\\'t have enough troops to deal with Afghanistan because we still have more troops in Iraq than we did before the surge.MCCAIN: Admiral Mullen suggests that Senator Obama\\'s plan is dangerous for America.OBAMA: That\\'s not the case.MCCAIN: That\\'s what ...OBAMA: What he said was a precipitous...MCCAIN: That\\'s what Admiral Mullen said.OBAMA: ... withdrawal would be dangerous. He did not say that. That\\'s not true.MCCAIN: And also General Petraeus said the same thing. Osama bin Laden and General Petraeus have one thing in common that I know of, they both said that Iraq is the central battleground.Now General Petraeus has praised the successes, but he said those successes are fragile and if we set a specific date for withdrawal -- and by the way, Senator Obama\\'s original plan, they would have been out last spring before the surge ever had a chance to succeed.And I\\'m -- I\\'m -- understand why Senator Obama was surprised and said that the surge succeeded beyond his wildest expectations.MCCAIN: It didn\\'t exceed beyond mine, because I know that that\\'s a strategy that has worked and can succeed. But if we snatch defeat from the jaws of victory and adopt Senator Obama\\'s plan, then we will have a wider war and it will make things more complicated throughout the region, including in Afghanistan.LEHRER: Afghanistan, lead -- a new -- a new lead question. Now, having resolved Iraq, we\\'ll move to Afghanistan.(LAUGHTER)And it goes to you, Senator Obama, and it\\'s a -- it picks up on a point that\\'s already been made. Do you think more troops -- more U.S. troops should be sent to Afghanistan, how many, and when?OBAMA: Yes, I think we need more troops. I\\'ve been saying that for over a year now.And I think that we have to do it as quickly as possible, because it\\'s been acknowledged by the commanders on the ground the situation is getting worse, not better.We had the highest fatalities among U.S. troops this past year than at any time since 2002. And we are seeing a major offensive taking place -- Al Qaida and Taliban crossing the border and attacking our troops in a brazen fashion. They are feeling emboldened.And we cannot separate Afghanistan from Iraq, because what our commanders have said is we don\\'t have the troops right now to deal with Afghanistan.So I would send two to three additional brigades to Afghanistan. Now, keep in mind that we have four times the number of troops in Iraq, where nobody had anything to do with 9/11 before we went in, where, in fact, there was no Al Qaida before we went in, but we have four times more troops there than we do in Afghanistan.And that is a strategic mistake, because every intelligence agency will acknowledge that Al Qaida is the greatest threat against the United States and that Secretary of Defense Gates acknowledged the central front -- that the place where we have to deal with these folks is going to be in Afghanistan and in Pakistan.So here\\'s what we have to do comprehensively, though. It\\'s not just more troops.We have to press the Afghan government to make certain that they are actually working for their people. And I\\'ve said this to President Karzai.Number two, we\\'ve got to deal with a growing poppy trade that has exploded over the last several years.Number three, we\\'ve got to deal with Pakistan, because Al Qaida and the Taliban have safe havens in Pakistan, across the border in the northwest regions, and although, you know, under George Bush, with the support of Senator McCain, we\\'ve been giving them $10 billion over the last seven years, they have not done what needs to be done to get rid of those safe havens.And until we do, Americans here at home are not going to be safe.LEHRER: Afghanistan, Senator McCain?MCCAIN: First of all, I won\\'t repeat the mistake that I regret enormously, and that is, after we were able to help the Afghan freedom fighters and drive the Russians out of Afghanistan, we basically washed our hands of the region.And the result over time was the Taliban, Al Qaida, and a lot of the difficulties we are facing today. So we can\\'t ignore those lessons of history.Now, on this issue of aiding Pakistan, if you\\'re going to aim a gun at somebody, George Shultz, our great secretary of state, told me once, you\\'d better be prepared to pull the trigger.I\\'m not prepared at this time to cut off aid to Pakistan. So I\\'m not prepared to threaten it, as Senator Obama apparently wants to do, as he has said that he would announce military strikes into Pakistan.We\\'ve got to get the support of the people of -- of Pakistan. He said that he would launch military strikes into Pakistan.Now, you don\\'t do that. You don\\'t say that out loud. If you have to do things, you have to do things, and you work with the Pakistani government.Now, the new president of Pakistan, Kardari (sic), has got his hands full. And this area on the border has not been governed since the days of Alexander the Great.I\\'ve been to Waziristan. I can see how tough that terrain is. It\\'s ruled by a handful of tribes.And, yes, Senator Obama calls for more troops, but what he doesn\\'t understand, it\\'s got to be a new strategy, the same strategy that he condemned in Iraq. It\\'s going to have to be employed in Afghanistan.And we\\'re going to have to help the Pakistanis go into these areas and obtain the allegiance of the people. And it\\'s going to be tough. They\\'ve intermarried with Al Qaida and the Taliban. And it\\'s going to be tough. But we have to get the cooperation of the people in those areas.And the Pakistanis are going to have to understand that that bombing in the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad was a signal from the terrorists that they don\\'t want that government to cooperate with us in combating the Taliban and jihadist elements.So we\\'ve got a lot of work to do in Afghanistan. But I\\'m confident, now that General Petraeus is in the new position of command, that we will employ a strategy which not only means additional troops -- and, by the way, there have been 20,000 additional troops, from 32,000 to 53,000, and there needs to be more.So it\\'s not just the addition of troops that matters. It\\'s a strategy that will succeed. And Pakistan is a very important element in this. And I know how to work with them. And I guarantee you I would not publicly state that I\\'m going to attack them.OBAMA: Nobody talked about attacking Pakistan. Here\\'s what I said.And if John wants to disagree with this, he can let me know, that, if the United States has Al Qaida, bin Laden, top-level lieutenants in our sights, and Pakistan is unable or unwilling to act, then we should take them out.Now, I think that\\'s the right strategy; I think that\\'s the right policy.And, John, I -- you\\'re absolutely right that presidents have to be prudent in what they say. But, you know, coming from you, who, you know, in the past has threatened extinction for North Korea and, you know, sung songs about bombing Iran, I don\\'t know, you know, how credible that is. I think this is the right strategy.Now, Senator McCain is also right that it\\'s difficult. This is not an easy situation. You\\'ve got cross-border attacks against U.S. troops.And we\\'ve got a choice. We could allow our troops to just be on the defensive and absorb those blows again and again and again, if Pakistan is unwilling to cooperate, or we have to start making some decisions.And the problem, John, with the strategy that\\'s been pursued was that, for 10 years, we coddled Musharraf, we alienated the Pakistani population, because we were anti-democratic. We had a 20th-century mindset that basically said, \"Well, you know, he may be a dictator, but he\\'s our dictator.\"And as a consequence, we lost legitimacy in Pakistan. We spent $10 billion. And in the meantime, they weren\\'t going after Al Qaida, and they are more powerful now than at any time since we began the war in Afghanistan.That\\'s going to change when I\\'m president of the United States.MCCAIN: I -- I don\\'t think that Senator Obama understands that there was a failed state in Pakistan when Musharraf came to power. Everybody who was around then, and had been there, and knew about it knew that it was a failed state.But let me tell you, you know, this business about bombing Iran and all that, let me tell you my record.Back in 1983, when I was a brand-new United States congressman, the one -- the person I admired the most and still admire the most, Ronald Reagan, wanted to send Marines into Lebanon.And I saw that, and I saw the situation, and I stood up, and I voted against that, because I was afraid that they couldn\\'t make peace in a place where 300 or 400 or several hundred Marines would make a difference. Tragically, I was right: Nearly 300 Marines lost their lives in the bombing of the barracks.And then we had Somalia -- then we had the first Gulf War. I supported -- I supported that.I supported us going into Bosnia, when a number of my own party and colleagues was against that operation in Bosnia. That was the right thing to do, to stop genocide and to preserve what was necessary inside of Europe.I supported what we did in Kosovo. I supported it because ethnic cleansing and genocide was taking place there.And I have a record -- and Somalia, I opposed that we should turn -- turn the force in Somalia from a peacekeeping force into a peacemaking force, which they were not capable of.So I have a record. I have a record of being involved in these national security issues, which involve the highest responsibility and the toughest decisions that any president can make, and that is to send our young men and women into harm\\'s way.And I\\'ll tell you, I had a town hall meeting in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, and a woman stood up and she said, \"Senator McCain, I want you to do me the honor of wearing a bracelet with my son\\'s name on it.\"He was 22 years old and he was killed in combat outside of Baghdad, Matthew Stanley, before Christmas last year. This was last August, a year ago. And I said, \"I will -- I will wear his bracelet with honor.\"And this was August, a year ago. And then she said, \"But, Senator McCain, I want you to do everything -- promise me one thing, that you\\'ll do everything in your power to make sure that my son\\'s death was not in vain.\"That means that that mission succeeds, just like those young people who re-enlisted in Baghdad, just like the mother I met at the airport the other day whose son was killed. And they all say to me that we don\\'t want defeat. I know what thatâ€™s like when an army is defeated.MCCAIN: A war that I was in, where we had an Army, that it wasn\\'t through any fault of their own, but they were defeated. And I know how hard it is for that -- for an Army and a military to recover from that. And it did and we will win this one and we won\\'t come home in defeat and dishonor and probably have to go back if we fail.OBAMA: Jim, let me just make a point. I\\'ve got a bracelet, too, from Sergeant - from the mother of Sergeant Ryan David Jopeck (ph), given to me in green bay. She asked me, can you please make sure another mother is not going through what I\\'m going through.No U.S. soldier ever dies in vain because they\\'re carrying out the missions of their commander in chief. And we honor all the service that they\\'ve provided. Our troops have performed brilliantly. The question is for the next president, are we making good judgments about how to keep America safe precisely because sending our military into battle is such an enormous step.And the point that I originally made is that we took our eye off Afghanistan, we took our eye off the folks who perpetrated 9/11, they are still sending out videotapes and Senator McCain, nobody is talking about defeat in Iraq, but I have to say we are having enormous problems in Afghanistan because of that decision.And it is not true you have consistently been concerned about what happened in Afghanistan. At one point, while you were focused on Iraq, you said well, we can \"muddle through\" Afghanistan. You don\\'t muddle through the central front on terror and you don\\'t muddle through going after bin Laden. You don\\'t muddle through stamping out the Taliban.I think that is something we have to take seriously. And when I\\'m president, I will.LEHRER: New ...MCCAIN: You might think that with that kind of concern that Senator Obama would have gone to Afghanistan, particularly given his responsibilities as a subcommittee chairman. By the way, when I\\'m subcommittee chairman, we take up the issues under my subcommittee. But the important thing is -- the important thing is I visited Afghanistan and I traveled to Waziristan and I traveled to these places and I know what our security requirements are. I know what our needs are. So the point is that we will prevail in Afghanistan, but we need the new strategy and we need it to succeed.But the important thing is, if we suffer defeat in Iraq, which General Petraeus predicts we will, if we adopted Senator Obama\\'s set date for withdrawal, then that will have a calamitous effect in Afghanistan and American national security interests in the region. Senator Obama doesn\\'t seem to understand there is a connected between the two.LEHRER: I have some good news and bad news for the two of you. You all are even on time, which is remarkable, considering we\\'ve been going at it ...OBAMA: A testimony to you, Jim.LEHRER: I don\\'t know about that. But the bad news is all my little five minute things have run over, so, anyhow, we\\'ll adjust as we get there. But the amount of time is even.New lead question. And it goes two minutes to you, Senator McCain, what is your reading on the threat from Iran right now to the security of the United States?MCCAIN: My reading of the threat from Iran is that if Iran acquires nuclear weapons, it is an existential threat to the State of Israel and it is a threat to other countries in the region because the other countries in the region will feel compelling requirement to acquire nuclear weapons as well.Now we cannot allow a second Holocaust. Let\\'s just make that very clear. What I have proposed for a long time, and I\\'ve had conversation with foreign leaders about forming a league of democracies, let\\'s be clear and let\\'s have some straight talk. The Russians are preventing significant action in the United Nations Security Council.I have proposed a league of democracies, a group of people - a group of countries that share common interests, common values, common ideals, they also control a lot of the world\\'s economic power. We could impose significant meaningful, painful sanctions on the Iranians that I think could have a beneficial effect.The Iranians have a lousy government, so therefore their economy is lousy, even though they have significant oil revenues. So I am convinced that together, we can, with the French, with the British, with the Germans and other countries, democracies around the world, we can affect Iranian behavior.But have no doubt, but have no doubt that the Iranians continue on the path to the acquisition of a nuclear weapon as we speak tonight. And it is a threat not only in this region but around the world.What I\\'d also like to point out the Iranians are putting the most lethal IEDs into Iraq which are killing young Americans, there are special groups in Iran coming into Iraq and are being trained in Iran. There is the Republican Guard in Iran, which Senator Kyl had an amendment in order to declare them a sponsor of terror. Senator Obama said that would be provocative.So this is a serious threat. This is a serious threat to security in the world, and I believe we can act and we can act with our friends and allies and reduce that threat as quickly as possible, but have no doubt about the ultimate result of them acquiring nuclear weapons.LEHRER: Two minutes on Iran, Senator Obama.OBAMA: Well, let me just correct something very quickly. I believe the Republican Guard of Iran is a terrorist organization. I\\'ve consistently said so. What Senator McCain refers to is a measure in the Senate that would try to broaden the mandate inside of Iraq. To deal with Iran.And ironically, the single thing that has strengthened Iran over the last several years has been the war in Iraq. Iraq was Iran\\'s mortal enemy. That was cleared away. And what we\\'ve seen over the last several years is Iran\\'s influence grow. They have funded Hezbollah, they have funded Hamas, they have gone from zero centrifuges to 4,000 centrifuges to develop a nuclear weapon.So obviously, our policy over the last eight years has not worked. Senator McCain is absolutely right, we cannot tolerate a nuclear Iran. It would be a game changer. Not only would it threaten Israel, a country that is our stalwart ally, but it would also create an environment in which you could set off an arms race in this Middle East.Now here\\'s what we need to do. We do need tougher sanctions. I do not agree with Senator McCain that we\\'re going to be able to execute the kind of sanctions we need without some cooperation with countries like Russia and China that are, I think Senator McCain would agree, not democracies, but have extensive trade with Iran but potentially have an interest in making sure Iran doesn\\'t have a nuclear weapon.But we are also going to have to, I believe, engage in tough direct diplomacy with Iran and this is a major difference I have with Senator McCain, this notion that by not talking to people we are punishing them has not worked. It has not worked in Iran, it has not worked in North Korea. In each instance, our efforts at isolation have actually accelerated their efforts to get nuclear weapons. That will change when I\\'m president of the United States.LEHRER: Senator, what about talking?MCCAIN: Senator Obama twice said in debates he would sit down with Ahmadinejad, Chavez and Raul Castro without precondition. Without precondition. Here is Ahmadinenene (ph), Ahmadinejad, who is, Ahmadinejad, who is now in New York, talking about the extermination of the State of Israel, of wiping Israel off the map, and we\\'re going to sit down, without precondition, across the table, to legitimize and give a propaganda platform to a person that is espousing the extermination of the state of Israel, and therefore then giving them more credence in the world arena and therefore saying, they\\'ve probably been doing the right thing, because you will sit down across the table from them and that will legitimize their illegal behavior.The point is that throughout history, whether it be Ronald Reagan, who wouldn\\'t sit down with Brezhnev, Andropov or Chernenko until Gorbachev was ready with glasnost and perestroika.Or whether it be Nixon\\'s trip to China, which was preceded by Henry Kissinger, many times before he went. Look, I\\'ll sit down with anybody, but there\\'s got to be pre-conditions. Those pre-conditions would apply that we wouldn\\'t legitimize with a face to face meeting, a person like Ahmadinejad. Now, Senator Obama said, without preconditions.OBAMA: So let\\'s talk about this. First of all, Ahmadinejad is not the most powerful person in Iran. So he may not be the right person to talk to. But I reserve the right, as president of the United States to meet with anybody at a time and place of my choosing if I think it\\'s going to keep America safe.And I\\'m glad that Senator McCain brought up the history, the bipartisan history of us engaging in direct diplomacy.OBAMA: Senator McCain mentioned Henry Kissinger, who\\'s one of his advisers, who, along with five recent secretaries of state, just said that we should meet with Iran -- guess what -- without precondition. This is one of your own advisers.Now, understand what this means \"without preconditions.\" It doesn\\'t mean that you invite them over for tea one day. What it means is that we don\\'t do what we\\'ve been doing, which is to say, \"Until you agree to do exactly what we say, we won\\'t have direct contacts with you.\"There\\'s a difference between preconditions and preparation. Of course we\\'ve got to do preparations, starting with low-level diplomatic talks, and it may not work, because Iran is a rogue regime. But I will point out that I was called naive when I suggested that we need to look at exploring contacts with Iran. And you know what? President Bush recently sent a senior ambassador, Bill Burns, to participate in talks with the Europeans around the issue of nuclear weapons.Again, it may not work, but if it doesn\\'t work, then we have strengthened our ability to form alliances to impose the tough sanctions that Senator McCain just mentioned.And when we haven\\'t done it, as in North Korea -- let me just take one more example -- in North Korea, we cut off talks. They\\'re a member of the axis of evil. We can\\'t deal with them.And you know what happened? They went -- they quadrupled their nuclear capacity. They tested a nuke. They tested missiles. They pulled out of the nonproliferation agreement. And they sent nuclear secrets, potentially, to countries like Syria.When we re-engaged -- because, again, the Bush administration reversed course on this -- then we have at least made some progress, although right now, because of the problems in North Korea, we are seeing it on shaky ground.And -- and I just -- so I just have to make this general point that the Bush administration, some of Senator McCain\\'s own advisers all think this is important, and Senator McCain appears resistant.He even said the other day that he would not meet potentially with the prime minister of Spain, because he -- you know, he wasn\\'t sure whether they were aligned with us. I mean, Spain? Spain is a NATO ally.MCCAIN: Of course.OBAMA: If we can\\'t meet with our friends, I don\\'t know how we\\'re going to lead the world in terms of dealing with critical issues like terrorism.MCCAIN: I\\'m not going to set the White House visitors schedule before I\\'m president of the United States. I don\\'t even have a seal yet.Look, Dr. Kissinger did not say that he would approve of face-to- face meetings between the president of the United States and the president -- and Ahmadinejad. He did not say that.OBAMA: Of course not.MCCAIN: He said that there could be secretary-level and lower level meetings. I\\'ve always encouraged them. The Iranians have met with Ambassador Crocker in Baghdad.What Senator Obama doesn\\'t seem to understand that if without precondition you sit down across the table from someone who has called Israel a \"stinking corpse,\" and wants to destroy that country and wipe it off the map, you legitimize those comments.This is dangerous. It isn\\'t just naive; it\\'s dangerous. And so we just have a fundamental difference of opinion.As far as North Korea is concerned, our secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, went to North Korea. By the way, North Korea, most repressive and brutal regime probably on Earth. The average South Korean is three inches taller than the average North Korean, a huge gulag.We don\\'t know what the status of the dear leader\\'s health is today, but we know this, that the North Koreans have broken every agreement that they\\'ve entered into.And we ought to go back to a little bit of Ronald Reagan\\'s \"trust, but verify,\" and certainly not sit down across the table from -- without precondition, as Senator Obama said he did twice, I mean, it\\'s just dangerous.OBAMA: Look, I mean, Senator McCain keeps on using this example that suddenly the president would just meet with somebody without doing any preparation, without having low-level talks. Nobody\\'s been talking about that, and Senator McCain knows it. This is a mischaracterization of my position.When we talk about preconditions -- and Henry Kissinger did say we should have contacts without preconditions -- the idea is that we do not expect to solve every problem before we initiate talks.And, you know, the Bush administration has come to recognize that it hasn\\'t worked, this notion that we are simply silent when it comes to our enemies. And the notion that we would sit with Ahmadinejad and not say anything while he\\'s spewing his nonsense and his vile comments is ridiculous. Nobody is even talking about that.MCCAIN: So let me get this right. We sit down with Ahmadinejad, and he says, \"We\\'re going to wipe Israel off the face of the Earth,\" and we say, \"No, you\\'re not\"? Oh, please.OBAMA: No, let me tell...(CROSSTALK)MCCAIN: By the way, my friend, Dr. Kissinger, who\\'s been my friend for 35 years, would be interested to hear this conversation and Senator Obama\\'s depiction of his -- of his positions on the issue. I\\'ve known him for 35 years.OBAMA: We will take a look.MCCAIN: And I guarantee you he would not -- he would not say that presidential top level.OBAMA: Nobody\\'s talking about that.MCCAIN: Of course he encourages and other people encourage contacts, and negotiations, and all other things. We do that all the time.LEHRER: We\\'re going to go to a new...(CROSSTALK)MCCAIN: And Senator Obama is parsing words when he says precondition means preparation.OBAMA: I am not parsing words.MCCAIN: He\\'s parsing words, my friends.OBAMA: I\\'m using the same words that your advisers use.Please, go ahead.LEHRER: New lead question.Russia, goes to you, two minutes, Senator Obama. How do you see the relationship with Russia? Do you see them as a competitor? Do you see them as an enemy? Do you see them as a potential partner?OBAMA: Well, I think that, given what\\'s happened over the last several weeks and months, our entire Russian approach has to be evaluated, because a resurgent and very aggressive Russia is a threat to the peace and stability of the region.Their actions in Georgia were unacceptable. They were unwarranted. And at this point, it is absolutely critical for the next president to make clear that we have to follow through on our six-party -- or the six-point cease-fire. They have to remove themselves from South Ossetia and Abkhazia.It is absolutely important that we have a unified alliance and that we explain to the Russians that you cannot be a 21st-century superpower, or power, and act like a 20th-century dictatorship.And we also have to affirm all the fledgling democracies in that region, you know, the Estonians, the Lithuanians, the Latvians, the Poles, the Czechs, that we are, in fact, going to be supportive and in solidarity with them in their efforts. They are members of NATO.And to countries like Georgia and the Ukraine, I think we have to insist that they are free to join NATO if they meet the requirements, and they should have a membership action plan immediately to start bringing them in.Now, we also can\\'t return to a Cold War posture with respect to Russia. It\\'s important that we recognize there are going to be some areas of common interest. One is nuclear proliferation.They have not only 15,000 nuclear warheads, but they\\'ve got enough to make another 40,000, and some of those loose nukes could fall into the hands of Al Qaida.This is an area where I\\'ve led on in the Senate, working with a Republican ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Dick Lugar, to deal with the proliferation of loose nuclear weapons. That\\'s an area where we\\'re going to have to work with Russia.But we have to have a president who is clear that you don\\'t deal with Russia based on staring into his eyes and seeing his soul. You deal with Russia based on, what are your -- what are the national security interests of the United States of America?And we have to recognize that the way they\\'ve been behaving lately demands a sharp response from the international community and our allies.LEHRER: Two minutes on Russia, Senator McCain.MCCAIN: Well, I was interested in Senator Obama\\'s reaction to the Russian aggression against Georgia. His first statement was, \"Both sides ought to show restraint.\"Again, a little bit of naivete there. He doesn\\'t understand that Russia committed serious aggression against Georgia. And Russia has now become a nation fueled by petro-dollars that is basically a KGB apparatchik-run government.I looked into Mr. Putin\\'s eyes, and I saw three letters, a \"K,\" a \"G,\" and a \"B.\" And their aggression in Georgia is not acceptable behavior.I don\\'t believe we\\'re going to go back to the Cold War. I am sure that that will not happen. But I do believe that we need to bolster our friends and allies. And that wasn\\'t just about a problem between Georgia and Russia. It had everything to do with energy.There\\'s a pipeline that runs from the Caspian through Georgia through Turkey. And, of course, we know that the Russians control other sources of energy into Europe, which they have used from time to time.It\\'s not accidental that the presidents of Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania, Poland, and Ukraine flew to Georgia, flew to Tbilisi, where I have spent significant amount of time with a great young president, Misha Saakashvili.MCCAIN: And they showed solidarity with them, but, also, they are very concerned about the Russian threats to regain their status of the old Russian to regain their status of the old Russian empire.Now, I think the Russians ought to understand that we will support -- we, the United States -- will support the inclusion of Georgia and Ukraine in the natural process, inclusion into NATO.We also ought to make it very clear that the Russians are in violation of their cease-fire agreement. They have stationed additional troops in Abkhazia and South Ossetia.By the way, I went there once, and we went inside and drove in, and there was a huge poster. And this is -- this is Georgian territory. And there was a huge poster of Vladimir Putin, and it said, \"Vladimir Putin, our president.\"It was very clear, the Russian intentions towards Georgia. They were just waiting to seize the opportunity.So, this is a very difficult situation. We want to work with the Russians. But we also have every right to expect the Russians to behave in a fashion and keeping with a -- with a -- with a country who respects international boundaries and the norms of international behavior.And watch Ukraine. This whole thing has got a lot to do with Ukraine, Crimea, the base of the Russian fleet in Sevastopol. And the breakdown of the political process in Ukraine between Tymoshenko and Yushchenko is a very serious problem.So watch Ukraine, and let\\'s make sure that we -- that the Ukrainians understand that we are their friend and ally.LEHRER: You see any -- do you have a major difference with what he just said?OBAMA: No, actually, I think Senator McCain and I agree for the most part on these issues. Obviously, I disagree with this notion that somehow we did not forcefully object to Russians going into Georgia.I immediately said that this was illegal and objectionable. And, absolutely, I wanted a cessation of the violence, because it put an enormous strain on Georgia, and that\\'s why I was the first to say that we have to rebuild the Georgian economy and called for a billion dollars that has now gone in to help them rebuild.Because part of Russia\\'s intentions here was to weaken the economy to the point where President Saakashvili was so weakened that he might be replaced by somebody that Putin favored more.Two points I think are important to think about when it comes to Russia.Number one is we have to have foresight and anticipate some of these problems. So back in April, I warned the administration that you had Russian peacekeepers in Georgian territory. That made no sense whatsoever.And what we needed to do was replace them with international peacekeepers and a special envoy to resolve the crisis before it boiled over.That wasn\\'t done. But had it been done, it\\'s possible we could have avoided the issue.The second point I want to make is -- is the issue of energy. Russia is in part resurgent and Putin is feeling powerful because of petro-dollars, as Senator McCain mentioned.That means that we, as one of the biggest consumers of oil -- 25 percent of the world\\'s oil -- have to have an energy strategy not just to deal with Russia, but to deal with many of the rogue states we\\'ve talked about, Iran, Venezuela.And that means, yes, increasing domestic production and off-shore drilling, but we only have 3 percent of the world\\'s oil supplies and we use 25 percent of the world\\'s oil. So we can\\'t simply drill our way out of the problem.What we\\'re going to have to do is to approach it through alternative energy, like solar, and wind, and biodiesel, and, yes, nuclear energy, clean-coal technology. And, you know, I\\'ve got a plan for us to make a significant investment over the next 10 years to do that.And I have to say, Senator McCain and I, I think agree on the importance of energy, but Senator McCain mentioned earlier the importance of looking at a record.Over 26 years, Senator McCain voted 23 times against alternative energy, like solar, and wind, and biodiesel.And so we -- we -- we\\'ve got to walk the walk and not just talk the talk when it comes to energy independence, because this is probably going to be just as vital for our economy and the pain that people are feeling at the pump -- and, you know, winter\\'s coming and home heating oil -- as it is our national security and the issue of climate change that\\'s so important.LEHRER: We\\'ve got time for one more lead question segment. We\\'re way out of...(CROSSTALK)LEHRER: Quick response and then...(CROSSTALK)MCCAIN: No one from Arizona is against solar. And Senator Obama says he\\'s for nuclear, but he\\'s against reprocessing and he\\'s against storing. So...OBAMA: That\\'s just not true, John. John, I\\'m sorry, but that\\'s not true.MCCAIN: ... it\\'s hard to get there from here. And off-shore drilling is also something that is very important and it is a bridge.And we know that, if we drill off-shore and exploit a lot of these reserves, it will help, at temporarily, relieve our energy requirements. And it will have, I think, an important effect on the price of a barrel of oil.OBAMA: I just have to respond very quickly, just to correct -- just to correct the record.MCCAIN: So I want to say that, with the Nunn-Lugar thing...LEHRER: Excuse me, Senator.OBAMA: John?MCCAIN: ... I supported Nunn-Lugar back in the early 1990s when a lot of my colleagues didn\\'t. That was the key legislation at the time and put us on the road to eliminating this issue of nuclear waste and the nuclear fuel that has to be taken care of.OBAMA: I -- I just have to correct the record here. I have never said that I object to nuclear waste. What I\\'ve said is that we have to store it safely.And, Senator McCain, he says -- he talks about Arizona.LEHRER: All right.OBAMA: I\\'ve got to make this point, Jim.LEHRER: OK.OBAMA: He objects...MCCAIN: I have voted for alternate fuel all of my time...OBAMA: He -- he -- he objects...(CROSSTALK)LEHRER: One at a time, please.OBAMA: He objected...LEHRER: One at a time.MCCAIN: No one can be opposed to alternate energy.OBAMA: All right, fair enough. Let\\'s move on. You\\'ve got one more energy -- you\\'ve got one more question.LEHRER: This is the last -- last lead question. You have two minutes each. And the question is this, beginning with you, Senator McCain.What do you think the likelihood is that there would be another 9/11-type attack on the continental United States?MCCAIN: I think it\\'s much less than it was the day after 9/11. I think it -- that we have a safer nation, but we are a long way from safe.And I want to tell you that one of the things I\\'m most proud of, among others, because I have worked across the aisle. I have a long record on that, on a long series of reforms.But after 9/11, Senator Joe Lieberman and I decided that we needed a commission, and that was a commission to investigate 9/11, and find out what happened, and fix it.And we were -- we were opposed by the administration, another area where I differed with this administration. And we were stymied until the families of 9/11 came, and they descended on Washington, and we got that legislation passed.And there were a series of recommendations, as I recall, more than 40. And I\\'m happy to say that we\\'ve gotten written into law most of those reforms recommended by that commission. I\\'m proud of that work, again, bipartisan, reaching across the aisle, working together, Democrat and Republican alike.So we have a long way to go in our intelligence services. We have to do a better job in human intelligence. And we\\'ve got to -- to make sure that we have people who are trained interrogators so that we don\\'t ever torture a prisoner ever again.We have to make sure that our technological and intelligence capabilities are better. We have to work more closely with our allies. I know our allies, and I can work much more closely with them.But I can tell you that I think America is safer today than it was on 9/11. But that doesn\\'t mean that we don\\'t have a long way to go.And I\\'d like to remind you, also, as a result of those recommendations, we\\'ve probably had the largest reorganization of government since we established the Defense Department. And I think that those men and women in those agencies are doing a great job.But we still have a long way to go before we can declare America safe, and that means doing a better job along our borders, as well.LEHRER: Two minutes, Senator Obama.OBAMA: Well, first of all, I think that we are safer in some ways. Obviously, we\\'ve poured billions of dollars into airport security. We have done some work in terms of securing potential targets, but we still have a long way to go.We\\'ve got to make sure that we\\'re hardening our chemical sites. We haven\\'t done enough in terms of transit; we haven\\'t done enough in terms of ports.And the biggest threat that we face right now is not a nuclear missile coming over the skies. It\\'s in a suitcase.This is why the issue of nuclear proliferation is so important. It is the -- the biggest threat to the United States is a terrorist getting their hands on nuclear weapons.And we -- we are spending billions of dollars on missile defense. And I actually believe that we need missile defense, because of Iran and North Korea and the potential for them to obtain or to launch nuclear weapons, but I also believe that, when we are only spending a few hundred million dollars on nuclear proliferation, then we\\'re making a mistake.The other thing that we have to focus on, though, is Al Qaida. They are now operating in 60 countries. We can\\'t simply be focused on Iraq. We have to go to the root cause, and that is in Afghanistan and Pakistan. That\\'s going to be critical. We are going to need more cooperation with our allies.And one last point I want to make. It is important for us to understand that the way we are perceived in the world is going to make a difference, in terms of our capacity to get cooperation and root out terrorism.And one of the things that I intend to do as president is to restore America\\'s standing in the world. We are less respected now than we were eight years ago or even four years ago.OBAMA: And this is the greatest country on Earth. But because of some of the mistakes that have been made -- and I give Senator McCain great credit on the torture issue, for having identified that as something that undermines our long-term security -- because of those things, we, I think, are going to have a lot of work to do in the next administration to restore that sense that America is that shining beacon on a hill.LEHRER: Do you agree there\\'s much to be done in a new administration to restore...(CROSSTALK)MCCAIN: But in the case of missile defense, Senator Obama said it had to be, quote, \"proven.\" That wasn\\'t proven when Ronald Reagan said we would do SDI, which is missile defense. And it was major -- a major factor in bringing about the end of the Cold War.We seem to come full circle again. Senator Obama still doesn\\'t quite understand -- or doesn\\'t get it -- that if we fail in Iraq, it encourages Al Qaida. They would establish a base in Iraq.The consequences of defeat, which would result from his plan of withdrawal and according to date certain, regardless of conditions, according to our military leaders, according to every expert, would lead to defeat -- possible defeat, loss of all the fragile sacrifice that we\\'ve made of American blood and treasure, which grieves us all.All of that would be lost if we followed Senator Obama\\'s plan to have specific dates with withdrawal, regardless of conditions on the ground.And General Petraeus says we have had great success, but it\\'s very fragile. And we can\\'t do what Senator Obama wants to do.That is the central issue of our time. And I think Americans will judge very seriously as to whether that\\'s the right path or the wrong path and who should be the next president of the United States.LEHRER: You see the same connections that Senator McCain does?OBAMA: Oh, there\\'s no doubt. Look, over the last eight years, this administration, along with Senator McCain, have been solely focused on Iraq. That has been their priority. That has been where all our resources have gone.In the meantime, bin Laden is still out there. He is not captured. He is not killed. Al Qaida is resurgent.In the meantime, we\\'ve got challenges, for example, with China, where we are borrowing billions of dollars. They now hold a trillion dollars\\' worth of our debt. And they are active in countries like -- in regions like Latin America, and Asia, and Africa. They are -- the conspicuousness of their presence is only matched by our absence, because we\\'ve been focused on Iraq.We have weakened our capacity to project power around the world because we have viewed everything through this single lens, not to mention, look at our economy. We are now spending $10 billion or more every month.And that means we can\\'t provide health care to people who need it. We can\\'t invest in science and technology, which will determine whether or not we are going to be competitive in the long term.There has never been a country on Earth that saw its economy decline and yet maintained its military superiority. So this is a national security issue.We haven\\'t adequately funded veterans\\' care. I sit on the Veterans Affairs Committee, and we\\'ve got -- I meet veterans all across the country who are trying to figure out, \"How can I get disability payments? I\\'ve got post-traumatic stress disorder, and yet I can\\'t get treatment.\"So we have put all chips in, right there, and nobody is talking about losing this war. What we are talking about is recognizing that the next president has to have a broader strategic vision about all the challenges that we face.That\\'s been missing over the last eight years. That sense is something that I want to restore.MCCAIN: I\\'ve been involved, as I mentioned to you before, in virtually every major national security challenge we\\'ve faced in the last 20-some years. There are some advantages to experience, and knowledge, and judgment.And I -- and I honestly don\\'t believe that Senator Obama has the knowledge or experience and has made the wrong judgments in a number of areas, including his initial reaction to Russian invasion -- aggression in Georgia, to his -- you know, we\\'ve seen this stubbornness before in this administration to cling to a belief that somehow the surge has not succeeded and failing to acknowledge that he was wrong about the surge is -- shows to me that we -- that -- that we need more flexibility in a president of the United States than that.As far as our other issues that he brought up are concerned, I know the veterans. I know them well. And I know that they know that I\\'ll take care of them. And I\\'ve been proud of their support and their recognition of my service to the veterans.And I love them. And I\\'ll take care of them. And they know that I\\'ll take care of them. And that\\'s going to be my job.But, also, I have the ability, and the knowledge, and the background to make the right judgments, to keep this country safe and secure.Reform, prosperity, and peace, these are major challenges to the United States of America. I don\\'t think I need any on-the-job training. I\\'m ready to go at it right now.OBAMA: Well, let me just make a closing point. You know, my father came from Kenya. That\\'s where I get my name.And in the \\'60s, he wrote letter after letter to come to college here in the United States because the notion was that there was no other country on Earth where you could make it if you tried. The ideals and the values of the United States inspired the entire world.I don\\'t think any of us can say that our standing in the world now, the way children around the world look at the United States, is the same.And part of what we need to do, what the next president has to do -- and this is part of our judgment, this is part of how we\\'re going to keep America safe -- is to -- to send a message to the world that we are going to invest in issues like education, we are going to invest in issues that -- that relate to how ordinary people are able to live out their dreams.And that is something that I\\'m going to be committed to as president of the United States.LEHRER: Few seconds. We\\'re almost finished.MCCAIN: Jim, when I came home from prison, I saw our veterans being very badly treated, and it made me sad. And I embarked on an effort to resolve the POW-MIA issue, which we did in a bipartisan fashion, and then I worked on normalization of relations between our two countries so that our veterans could come all the way home.I guarantee you, as president of the United States, I know how to heal the wounds of war, I know how to deal with our adversaries, and I know how to deal with our friends.LEHRER: And that ends this debate tonight.On October 2nd, next Thursday, also at 9:00 p.m. Eastern time, the two vice presidential candidates will debate at Washington University in St. Louis. My PBS colleague, Gwen Ifill, will be the moderator.For now, from Oxford, Mississippi, thank you, senators, both. I\\'m Jim Lehrer. Thank you, and good night.(APPLAUSE)ENDTranscription by: CQ Transcriptions/MorningsideÂ ',\n",
       " 'September 30. 2004 Debate TranscriptSeptember 30, 2004The First Bush-Kerry Presidential DebatePRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES\\' DEBATE, SPONSORED BY THE MICCOSUKEE TRIBE OF INDIANS OF FLORIDA, UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI, CORAL GABLES, FLORIDASPEAKERS: GEORGE W. BUSH, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATESU.S. SENATOR JOHN F. KERRY (MA), DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEEJIM LEHRER, ANCHOR AND EXECUTIVE EDITOR, PBS\\'S \"THE NEWSHOUR\"LEHRER: Good evening from the University of Miami Convocation Center in Coral Gables, Florida. I\\'m Jim Lehrer of \"The NewsHour\" on PBS.And I welcome you to the first of the 2004 presidential debates between President George W. Bush, the Republican nominee, and Senator John Kerry, the Democratic nominee.These debates are sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates.Tonight\\'s will last 90 minutes, following detailed rules of engagement worked out by representatives of the candidates. I have agreed to enforce their rules on them.The umbrella topic is foreign policy and homeland security, but the specific subjects were chosen by me, the questions were composed by me, the candidates have not been told what they are, nor has anyone else.For each question there can only be a two-minute response, a 90- second rebuttal and, at my discretion, a discussion extension of one minute.A green light will come on when 30 seconds remain in any given answer, yellow at 15, red at five seconds, and then flashing red means time\\'s up. There is also a backup buzzer system if needed.Candidates may not direct a question to each other. There will be two-minute closing statements, but no opening statements.There is an audience here in the hall, but they will remain absolutely silent for the next 90 minutes, except for now, when they join me in welcoming President Bush and Senator Kerry.(APPLAUSE)LEHRER: Good evening, Mr. President, Senator Kerry.As determined by a coin toss, the first question goes to you, Senator Kerry. You have two minutes.Do you believe you could do a better job than President Bush in preventing another 9/11-type terrorist attack on the United States?KERRY: Yes, I do.But before I answer further, let me thank you for moderating. I want to thank the University of Miami for hosting us. And I know the president will join me in welcoming all of Florida to this debate. You\\'ve been through the roughest weeks anybody could imagine. Our hearts go out to you. And we admire your pluck and perseverance.I can make American safer than President Bush has made us.And I believe President Bush and I both love our country equally. But we just have a different set of convictions about how you make America safe.I believe America is safest and strongest when we are leading the world and we are leading strong alliances.I\\'ll never give a veto to any country over our security. But I also know how to lead those alliances.This president has left them in shatters across the globe, and we\\'re now 90 percent of the casualties in Iraq and 90 percent of the costs.I think that\\'s wrong, and I think we can do better.I have a better plan for homeland security. I have a better plan to be able to fight the war on terror by strengthening our military, strengthening our intelligence, by going after the financing more authoritatively, by doing what we need to do to rebuild the alliances, by reaching out to the Muslim world, which the president has almost not done, and beginning to isolate the radical Islamic Muslims, not have them isolate the United States of America.I know I can do a better job in Iraq. I have a plan to have a summit with all of the allies, something this president has not yet achieved, not yet been able to do to bring people to the table.We can do a better job of training the Iraqi forces to defend themselves, and I know that we can do a better job of preparing for elections.All of these, and especially homeland security, which we\\'ll talk about a little bit later.LEHRER: Mr. President, you have a 90-second rebuttal.BUSH: I, too, thank the University of Miami, and say our prayers are with the good people of this state, who\\'ve suffered a lot.September the 11th changed how America must look at the world. And since that day, our nation has been on a multi-pronged strategy to keep our country safer.We pursued Al Qaida wherever Al Qaida tries to hide. Seventy-five percent of known Al Qaida leaders have been brought to justice. The rest of them know we\\'re after them.We\\'ve upheld the doctrine that said if you harbor a terrorist, you\\'re equally as guilty as the terrorist.And the Taliban are no longer in power. Ten million people have registered to vote in Afghanistan in the upcoming presidential election.In Iraq, we saw a threat, and we realized that after September the 11th, we must take threats seriously, before they fully materialize. Saddam Hussein now sits in a prison cell. America and the world are safer for it. We continue to pursue our policy of disrupting those who proliferate weapons of mass destruction.Libya has disarmed. The A.Q. Khan network has been brought to justice.And, as well, we\\'re pursuing a strategy of freedom around the world, because I understand free nations will reject terror. Free nations will answer the hopes and aspirations of their people. Free nations will help us achieve the peace we all want.LEHRER: New question, Mr. President, two minutes.Do you believe the election of Senator Kerry on November the 2nd would increase the chances of the U.S. being hit by another 9/11-type terrorist attack?BUSH: No, I don\\'t believe it\\'s going to happen. I believe I\\'m going to win, because the American people know I know how to lead. I\\'ve shown the American people I know how to lead.I have -- I understand everybody in this country doesn\\'t agree with the decisions I\\'ve made. And I made some tough decisions. But people know where I stand.People out there listening know what I believe. And that\\'s how best it is to keep the peace.This nation of ours has got a solemn duty to defeat this ideology of hate. And that\\'s what they are. This is a group of killers who will not only kill here, but kill children in Russia, that\\'ll attack unmercifully in Iraq, hoping to shake our will.We have a duty to defeat this enemy. We have a duty to protect our children and grandchildren.The best way to defeat them is to never waver, to be strong, to use every asset at our disposal, is to constantly stay on the offensive and, at the same time, spread liberty.And that\\'s what people are seeing now is happening in Afghanistan.Ten million citizens have registered to vote. It\\'s a phenomenal statistic. That if given a chance to be free, they will show up at the polls. Forty-one percent of those 10 million are women.In Iraq, no doubt about it, it\\'s tough. It\\'s hard work. It\\'s incredibly hard. You know why? Because an enemy realizes the stakes. The enemy understands a free Iraq will be a major defeat in their ideology of hatred. That\\'s why they\\'re fighting so vociferously.They showed up in Afghanistan when they were there, because they tried to beat us and they didn\\'t. And they\\'re showing up in Iraq for the same reason. They\\'re trying to defeat us.And if we lose our will, we lose. But if we remain strong and resolute, we will defeat this enemy.LEHRER: Ninety second response, Senator Kerry.KERRY: I believe in being strong and resolute and determined. And I will hunt down and kill the terrorists, wherever they are.But we also have to be smart, Jim. And smart means not diverting your attention from the real war on terror in Afghanistan against Osama bin Laden and taking if off to Iraq where the 9/11 Commission confirms there was no connection to 9/11 itself and Saddam Hussein, and where the reason for going to war was weapons of mass destruction, not the removal of Saddam Hussein.This president has made, I regret to say, a colossal error of judgment. And judgment is what we look for in the president of the United States of America.I\\'m proud that important military figures who are supporting me in this race: former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff John Shalikashvili; just yesterday, General Eisenhower\\'s son, General John Eisenhower, endorsed me; General Admiral William Crown; General Tony McBeak, who ran the Air Force war so effectively for his father -- all believe I would make a stronger commander in chief. And they believe it because they know I would not take my eye off of the goal: Osama bin Laden.Unfortunately, he escaped in the mountains of Tora Bora. We had him surrounded. But we didn\\'t use American forces, the best trained in the world, to go kill him. The president relied on Afghan warlords and he outsourced that job too. That\\'s wrong.LEHRER: New question, two minutes, Senator Kerry.\"Colossal misjudgments.\" What colossal misjudgments, in your opinion, has President Bush made in these areas?KERRY: Well, where do you want me to begin?First of all, he made the misjudgment of saying to America that he was going to build a true alliance, that he would exhaust the remedies of the United Nations and go through the inspections.In fact, he first didn\\'t even want to do that. And it wasn\\'t until former Secretary of State Jim Baker and General Scowcroft and others pushed publicly and said you\\'ve got to go to the U.N., that the president finally changed his mind -- his campaign has a word for that -- and went to the United Nations.Now, once there, we could have continued those inspections.We had Saddam Hussein trapped.He also promised America that he would go to war as a last resort.Those words mean something to me, as somebody who has been in combat. \"Last resort.\" You\\'ve got to be able to look in the eyes of families and say to those parents, \"I tried to do everything in my power to prevent the loss of your son and daughter.\"I don\\'t believe the United States did that.And we pushed our allies aside.And so, today, we are 90 percent of the casualties and 90 percent of the cost: $200 billion -- $200 billion that could have been used for health care, for schools, for construction, for prescription drugs for seniors, and it\\'s in Iraq.And Iraq is not even the center of the focus of the war on terror. The center is Afghanistan, where, incidentally, there were more Americans killed last year than the year before; where the opium production is 75 percent of the world\\'s opium production; where 40 to 60 percent of the economy of Afghanistan is based on opium; where the elections have been postponed three times.The president moved the troops, so he\\'s got 10 times the number of troops in Iraq than he has in Afghanistan, where Osama bin Laden is. Does that mean that Saddam Hussein was 10 times more important than Osama bin Laden -- than, excuse me, Saddam Hussein more important than Osama bin Laden? I don\\'t think so.LEHRER: Ninety-second response, Mr. President.BUSH: My opponent looked at the same intelligence I looked at and declared in 2002 that Saddam Hussein was a grave threat.He also said in December of 2003 that anyone who doubts that the world is safer without Saddam Hussein does not have the judgment to be president.I agree with him. The world is better off without Saddam Hussein.I was hoping diplomacy would work. I understand the serious consequences of committing our troops into harm\\'s way.It\\'s the hardest decision a president makes. So I went to the United Nations. I didn\\'t need anybody to tell me to go to the United Nations. I decided to go there myself.And I went there hoping that, once and for all, the free world would act in concert to get Saddam Hussein to listen to our demands. They passed the resolution that said, \"Disclose, disarm, or face serious consequences.\" I believe, when an international body speaks, it must mean what it says.Saddam Hussein had no intention of disarming. Why should he? He had 16 other resolutions and nothing took place. As a matter of fact, my opponent talks about inspectors. The facts are that he was systematically deceiving the inspectors.That wasn\\'t going to work. That\\'s kind of a pre-September 10th mentality, the hope that somehow resolutions and failed inspections would make this world a more peaceful place. He was hoping we\\'d turn away. But there was fortunately others beside myself who believed that we ought to take action.We did. The world is safer without Saddam Hussein.LEHRER: New question, Mr. President. Two minutes.What about Senator Kerry\\'s point, the comparison he drew between the priorities of going after Osama bin Laden and going after Saddam Hussein?BUSH: Jim, we\\'ve got the capability of doing both.As a matter of fact, this is a global effort.We\\'re facing a group of folks who have such hatred in their heart, they\\'ll strike anywhere, with any means.And that\\'s why it\\'s essential that we have strong alliances, and we do.That\\'s why it\\'s essential that we make sure that we keep weapons of mass destruction out of the hands of people like Al Qaida, which we are.But to say that there\\'s only one focus on the war on terror doesn\\'t really understand the nature of the war on terror.Of course we\\'re after Saddam Hussein -- I mean bin Laden. He\\'s isolated. Seventy-five percent of his people have been brought to justice. The killer -- the mastermind of the September 11th attacks, Khalid Sheik Mohammed, is in prison.We\\'re making progress.But the front on this war is more than just one place. The Philippines -- we\\'ve got help -- we\\'re helping them there to bring -- to bring Al Qaida affiliates to justice there.And, of course, Iraq is a central part in the war on terror. That\\'s why Zarqawi and his people are trying to fight us. Their hope is that we grow weary and we leave.The biggest disaster that could happen is that we not succeed in Iraq. We will succeed. We\\'ve got a plan to do so. And the main reason we\\'ll succeed is because the Iraqis want to be free.I had the honor of visiting with Prime Minister Allawi. He\\'s a strong, courageous leader. He believes in the freedom of the Iraqi people.He doesn\\'t want U.S. leadership, however, to send mixed signals, to not stand with the Iraqi people.He believes, like I believe, that the Iraqis are ready to fight for their own freedom. They just need the help to be trained. There will be elections in January. We\\'re spending reconstruction money. And our alliance is strong.That\\'s the plan for victory.And when Iraq if free, America will be more secure.LEHRER: Senator Kerry, 90 seconds.KERRY: The president just talked about Iraq as a center of the war on terror. Iraq was not even close to the center of the war on terror before the president invaded it.The president made the judgment to divert forces from under General Tommy Franks from Afghanistan before the Congress even approved it to begin to prepare to go to war in Iraq.And he rushed the war in Iraq without a plan to win the peace. Now, that is not the judgment that a president of the United States ought to make. You don\\'t take America to war unless have the plan to win the peace. You don\\'t send troops to war without the body armor that they need.I\\'ve met kids in Ohio, parents in Wisconsin places, Iowa, where they\\'re going out on the Internet to get the state-of-the-art body gear to send to their kids. Some of them got it for a birthday present.I think that\\'s wrong. Humvees -- 10,000 out of 12,000 Humvees that are over there aren\\'t armored. And you go visit some of those kids in the hospitals today who were maimed because they don\\'t have the armament.This president just -- I don\\'t know if he sees what\\'s really happened over there. But it\\'s getting worse by the day. More soldiers killed in June than before. More in July than June. More in August than July. More in September than in August.And now we see beheadings. And we got weapons of mass destruction crossing the border every single day, and they\\'re blowing people up. And we don\\'t have enough troops there.BUSH: Can I respond to that?LEHRER: Let\\'s do one of these one-minute extensions. You have 30 seconds.BUSH: Thank you, sir. First of all, what my opponent wants you to forget is that he voted to authorize the use of force and now says it\\'s the wrong war at the wrong time at the wrong place.I don\\'t see how you can lead this country to succeed in Iraq if you say wrong war, wrong time, wrong place. What message does that send our troops? What message does that send to our allies? What message does that send the Iraqis?No, the way to win this is to be steadfast and resolved and to follow through on the plan that I\\'ve just outlined.LEHRER: Thirty seconds, Senator.KERRY: Yes, we have to be steadfast and resolved, and I am. And I will succeed for those troops, now that we\\'re there. We have to succeed. We can\\'t leave a failed Iraq. But that doesn\\'t mean it wasn\\'t a mistake of judgment to go there and take the focus off of Osama bin Laden. It was. Now, we can succeed. But I don\\'t believe this president can. I think we need a president who has the credibility to bring the allies back to the table and to do what\\'s necessary to make it so America isn\\'t doing this alone.LEHRER: We\\'ll come back to Iraq in a moment. But I want to come back to where I began, on homeland security. This is a two-minute new question, Senator Kerry.As president, what would you do, specifically, in addition to or differently to increase the homeland security of the United States than what President Bush is doing?KERRY: Jim, let me tell you exactly what I\\'ll do. And there are a long list of thing. First of all, what kind of mixed message does it send when you have $500 million going over to Iraq to put police officers in the streets of Iraq, and the president is cutting the COPS program in America?What kind of message does it send to be sending money to open firehouses in Iraq, but we\\'re shutting firehouses who are the first- responders here in America.The president hasn\\'t put one nickel, not one nickel into the effort to fix some of our tunnels and bridges and most exposed subway systems. That\\'s why they had to close down the subway in New York when the Republican Convention was there. We hadn\\'t done the work that ought to be done.The president -- 95 percent of the containers that come into the ports, right here in Florida, are not inspected. Civilians get onto aircraft, and their luggage is X-rayed, but the cargo hold is not X- rayed.Does that make you feel safer in America?This president thought it was more important to give the wealthiest people in America a tax cut rather than invest in homeland security. Those aren\\'t my values. I believe in protecting America first.And long before President Bush and I get a tax cut -- and that\\'s who gets it -- long before we do, I\\'m going to invest in homeland security and I\\'m going to make sure we\\'re not cutting COPS programs in America and we\\'re fully staffed in our firehouses and that we protect the nuclear and chemical plants.The president also unfortunately gave in to the chemical industry, which didn\\'t want to do some of the things necessary to strengthen our chemical plant exposure.And there\\'s an enormous undone job to protect the loose nuclear materials in the world that are able to get to terrorists. That\\'s a whole other subject, but I see we still have a little bit more time.Let me just quickly say, at the current pace, the president will not secure the loose material in the Soviet Union -- former Soviet Union for 13 years. I\\'m going to do it in four years. And we\\'re going to keep it out of the hands of terrorists.LEHRER: Ninety-second response, Mr. President.BUSH: I don\\'t think we want to get to how he\\'s going to pay for all these promises. It\\'s like a huge tax gap. Anyway, that\\'s for another debate.My administration has tripled the amount of money we\\'re spending on homeland security to $30 billion a year.My administration worked with the Congress to create the Department of Homeland Security so we could better coordinate our borders and ports. We\\'ve got 1,000 extra border patrol on the southern border; want 1,000 on the northern border. We\\'re modernizing our borders.We spent $3.1 billion for fire and police, $3.1 billion.We\\'re doing our duty to provide the funding.But the best way to protect this homeland is to stay on the offense.You know, we have to be right 100 percent of the time. And the enemy only has to be right once to hurt us.There\\'s a lot of good people working hard.And by the way, we\\'ve also changed the culture of the FBI to have counterterrorism as its number one priority. We\\'re communicating better. We\\'re going to reform our intelligence services to make sure that we get the best intelligence possible.The Patriot Act is vital -- is vital that the Congress renew the Patriot Act which enables our law enforcement to disrupt terror cells.But again, I repeat to my fellow citizens, the best way to protection is to stay on the offense.LEHRER: Yes, let\\'s do a little -- yes, 30 seconds.KERRY: The president just said the FBI had changed its culture. We just read on the front pages of America\\'s papers that there are over 100,000 hours of tapes, unlistened to. On one of those tapes may be the enemy being right the next time.And the test is not whether you\\'re spending more money. The test is, are you doing everything possible to make America safe?We didn\\'t need that tax cut. America needed to be safe.BUSH: Of course we\\'re doing everything we can to protect America. I wake up every day thinking about how best to protect America. That\\'s my job.I work with Director Mueller of the FBI; comes in my office when I\\'m in Washington every morning, talking about how to protect us. There\\'s a lot of really good people working hard to do so.It\\'s hard work. But, again, I want to tell the American people, we\\'re doing everything we can at home, but you better have a president who chases these terrorists down and bring them to justice before they hurt us again.LEHRER: New question, Mr. President. Two minutes.What criteria would you use to determine when to start bringing U.S. troops home from Iraq?BUSH: Let me first tell you that the best way for Iraq to be safe and secure is for Iraqi citizens to be trained to do the job.And that\\'s what we\\'re doing. We\\'ve got 100,000 trained now, 125,000 by the end of this year, 200,000 by the end of next year. That is the best way. We\\'ll never succeed in Iraq if the Iraqi citizens do not want to take matters into their own hands to protect themselves. I believe they want to. Prime Minister Allawi believes they want to.And so the best indication about when we can bring our troops home -- which I really want to do, but I don\\'t want to do so for the sake of bringing them home; I want to do so because we\\'ve achieved an objective -- is to see the Iraqis perform and to see the Iraqis step up and take responsibility.And so, the answer to your question is: When our general is on the ground and Ambassador Negroponte tells me that Iraq is ready to defend herself from these terrorists, that elections will have been held by then, that their stability and that they\\'re on their way to, you know, a nation that\\'s free; that\\'s when.And I hope it\\'s as soon as possible. But I know putting artificial deadlines won\\'t work. My opponent at one time said, \"Well, get me elected, I\\'ll have them out of there in six months.\" You can\\'t do that and expect to win the war on terror. My message to our troops is, \"Thank you for what you\\'re doing. We\\'re standing with you strong. We\\'ll give you all the equipment you need. And we\\'ll get you home as soon as the mission\\'s done, because this is a vital mission.\"A free Iraq will be an ally in the war on terror, and that\\'s essential. A free Iraq will set a powerful example in the part of the world that is desperate for freedom. A free Iraq will help secure Israel. A free Iraq will enforce the hopes and aspirations of the reformers in places like Iran. A free Iraq is essential for the security of this country.LEHRER: Ninety seconds, Senator Kerry.KERRY: Thank you, Jim.My message to the troops is also: Thank you for what they\\'re doing, but it\\'s also help is on the way. I believe those troops deserve better than what they are getting today.You know, it\\'s interesting. When I was in a rope line just the other day, coming out here from Wisconsin, a couple of young returnees were in the line, one active duty, one from the Guard. And they both looked at me and said: We need you. You\\'ve got to help us over there.Now I believe there\\'s a better way to do this. You know, the president\\'s father did not go into Iraq, into Baghdad, beyond Basra. And the reason he didn\\'t is, he said -- he wrote in his book -- because there was no viable exit strategy. And he said our troops would be occupiers in a bitterly hostile land.That\\'s exactly where we find ourselves today. There\\'s a sense of American occupation. The only building that was guarded when the troops when into Baghdad was the oil ministry. We didn\\'t guard the nuclear facilities.We didn\\'t guard the foreign office, where you might have found information about weapons of mass destruction. We didn\\'t guard the borders.Almost every step of the way, our troops have been left on these extraordinarily difficult missions. I know what it\\'s like to go out on one of those missions when you don\\'t know what\\'s around the corner.And I believe our troops need other allies helping. I\\'m going to hold that summit. I will bring fresh credibility, a new start, and we will get the job done right.LEHRER: All right, go ahead. Yes, sir?BUSH: I think it\\'s worthy for a follow-up.LEHRER: Sure, right.(CROSSTALK) LEHRER: We can do 30 seconds each here. All right.BUSH: My opponent says help is on the way, but what kind of message does it say to our troops in harm\\'s way, \"wrong war, wrong place, wrong time\"? Not a message a commander in chief gives, or this is a \"great diversion.\"As well, help is on the way, but it\\'s certainly hard to tell it when he voted against the $87-billion supplemental to provide equipment for our troops, and then said he actually did vote for it before he voted against it.Not what a commander in chief does when you\\'re trying to lead troops.LEHRER: Senator Kerry, 30 seconds.KERRY: Well, you know, when I talked about the $87 billion, I made a mistake in how I talk about the war. But the president made a mistake in invading Iraq. Which is worse?I believe that when you know something\\'s going wrong, you make it right. That\\'s what I learned in Vietnam. When I came back from that war I saw that it was wrong. Some people don\\'t like the fact that I stood up to say no, but I did. And that\\'s what I did with that vote. And I\\'m going to lead those troops to victory.LEHRER: All right, new question. Two minutes, Senator Kerry.Speaking of Vietnam, you spoke to Congress in 1971, after you came back from Vietnam, and you said, quote, \"How do you ask a man to be the last man to die for a mistake?\"Are Americans now dying in Iraq for a mistake?KERRY: No, and they don\\'t have to, providing we have the leadership that we put -- that I\\'m offering.I believe that we have to win this. The president and I have always agreed on that. And from the beginning, I did vote to give the authority, because I thought Saddam Hussein was a threat, and I did accept that intelligence.But I also laid out a very strict series of things we needed to do in order to proceed from a position of strength. Then the president, in fact, promised them. He went to Cincinnati and he gave a speech in which he said, \"We will plan carefully. We will proceed cautiously. We will not make war inevitable. We will go with our allies.\"He didn\\'t do any of those things. They didn\\'t do the planning. They left the planning of the State Department in the State Department desks. They avoided even the advice of their own general. General Shinsheki, the Army chief of staff, said you\\'re going to need several hundred thousand troops. Instead of listening to him, they retired him. The terrorism czar, who has worked for every president since Ronald Reagan, said, \"Invading Iraq in response to 9/11 would be like Franklin Roosevelt invading Mexico in response to Pearl Harbor.\" That\\'s what we have here.And what we need now is a president who understands how to bring these other countries together to recognize their stakes in this. They do have stakes in it. They\\'ve always had stakes in it.The Arab countries have a stake in not having a civil war. The European countries have a stake in not having total disorder on their doorstep.But this president hasn\\'t even held the kind of statesman-like summits that pull people together and get them to invest in those states. In fact, he\\'s done the opposite. He pushed them away.When the Secretary General Kofi Annan offered the United Nations, he said, \"No, no, we\\'ll go do this alone.\"To save for Halliburton the spoils of the war, they actually issued a memorandum from the Defense Department saying, \"If you weren\\'t with us in the war, don\\'t bother applying for any construction.\"That\\'s not a way to invite people.LEHRER: Ninety seconds.BUSH: That\\'s totally absurd. Of course, the U.N. was invited in. And we support the U.N. efforts there. They pulled out after Sergio de Mello got killed. But they\\'re now back in helping with elections.My opponent says we didn\\'t have any allies in this war. What\\'s he say to Tony Blair? What\\'s he say to Alexander Kwasniewski of Poland? You can\\'t expect to build an alliance when you denigrate the contributions of those who are serving side by side with American troops in Iraq.Plus, he says the cornerstone of his plan to succeed in Iraq is to call upon nations to serve. So what\\'s the message going to be: \"Please join us in Iraq. For a grand diversion. Join us for a war that is the wrong war at the wrong place at the wrong time?\"I know how these people think. I deal with them all the time. I sit down with the world leaders frequently and talk to them on the phone frequently. They\\'re not going to follow somebody who says, \"This is the wrong war at the wrong place at the wrong time.\"They\\'re not going to follow somebody who says this is the wrong war at the wrong place at the wrong time. They\\'re not going to follow somebody whose core convictions keep changing because of politics in America.And finally, he says we ought to have a summit. Well, there are summits being held. Japan is going to have a summit for the donors; $14 billion pledged. And Prime Minister Koizumi is going to call countries to account, to get them to contribute.And there\\'s going to be an Arab summit, of the neighborhood countries. And Colin Powell helped set up that summit.LEHRER: 30 seconds, Senator.KERRY: The United Nations, Kofi Annan offered help after Baghdad fell. And we never picked him up on that and did what was necessary to transfer authority and to transfer reconstruction. It was always American-run.Secondly, when we went in, there were three countries: Great Britain, Australia and the United States. That\\'s not a grand coalition. We can do better.LEHRER: Thirty seconds, Mr. President.BUSH: Well, actually, he forgot Poland. And now there\\'s 30 nations involved, standing side by side with our American troops.And I honor their sacrifices. And I don\\'t appreciate it when a candidate for president denigrates the contributions of these brave soldiers.You cannot lead the world if you do not honor the contributions of those who are with us. He called them coerced and the bribed. That\\'s not how you bring people together.Our coalition is strong. It will remain strong, so long as I\\'m the president.LEHRER: New question, Mr. President, two minutes. You have said there was a, quote, \"miscalculation,\" of what the conditions would be in post-war Iraq. What was the miscalculation, and how did it happen?BUSH: No, what I said was that, because we achieved such a rapid victory, more of the Saddam loyalists were around. I mean, we thought we\\'d whip more of them going in.But because Tommy Franks did such a great job in planning the operations, we moved rapidly, and a lot of the Baathists and Saddam loyalists laid down their arms and disappeared. I thought they would stay and fight, but they didn\\'t.And now we\\'re fighting them now. And it\\'s hard work. I understand how hard it is. I get the casualty reports every day. I see on the TV screens how hard it is. But it\\'s necessary work.And I\\'m optimistic. See, I think you can be realistic and optimistic at the same time. I\\'m optimistic we\\'ll achieve -- I know we won\\'t achieve if we send mixed signals. I know we\\'re not going to achieve our objective if we send mixed signals to our troops, our friends, the Iraqi citizens.We\\'ve got a plan in place. The plan says there will be elections in January, and there will be. The plan says we\\'ll train Iraqi soldiers so they can do the hard work, and we are.And it\\'s not only just America, but NATO is now helping, Jordan\\'s helping train police, UAE is helping train police.We\\'ve allocated $7 billion over the next months for reconstruction efforts. And we\\'re making progress there.And our alliance is strong. And as I just told you, there\\'s going to be a summit of the Arab nations. Japan will be hosting a summit. We\\'re making progress.It is hard work. It is hard work to go from a tyranny to a democracy. It\\'s hard work to go from a place where people get their hands cut off, or executed, to a place where people are free.But it\\'s necessary work. And a free Iraq is going to make this world a more peaceful place.LEHRER: Ninety seconds, Senator Kerry.KERRY: What I think troubles a lot of people in our country is that the president has just sort of described one kind of mistake. But what he has said is that, even knowing there were no weapons of mass destruction, even knowing there was no imminent threat, even knowing there was no connection with Al Qaida, he would still have done everything the same way. Those are his words.Now, I would not. So what I\\'m trying to do is just talk the truth to the American people and to the world. The truth is what good policy is based on. It\\'s what leadership is based on.The president says that I\\'m denigrating these troops. I have nothing but respect for the British, Tony Blair, and for what they\\'ve been willing to do.But you can\\'t tell me that when the most troops any other country has on the ground is Great Britain, with 8,300, and below that the four others are below 4,000, and below that, there isn\\'t anybody out of the hundreds, that we have a genuine coalition to get this job done.You can\\'t tell me that on the day that we went into that war and it started -- it was principally the United States, the America and Great Britain and one or two others. That\\'s it. And today, we are 90 percent of the casualties and 90 percent of the costs. And meanwhile, North Korea has got nuclear weapons. Talk about mixed messages. The president is the one that said, \"We can\\'t allow countries to get nuclear weapons.\" They have. I\\'ll change that.LEHRER: New question. Senator Kerry, two minutes. You just -- you\\'ve repeatedly accused President Bush -- not here tonight, but elsewhere before -- of not telling the truth about Iraq, essentially of lying to the American people about Iraq. Give us some examples of what you consider to be his not telling the truth.KERRY: Well, I\\'ve never, ever used the harshest word, as you did just then. And I try not to. I\\'ve been -- but I\\'ll nevertheless tell you that I think he has not been candid with the American people. And I\\'ll tell you exactly how.First of all, we all know that in his state of the union message, he told Congress about nuclear materials that didn\\'t exist.We know that he promised America that he was going to build this coalition. I just described the coalition. It is not the kind of coalition we were described when we were talking about voting for this.The president said he would exhaust the remedies of the United Nations and go through that full process. He didn\\'t. He cut if off, sort of arbitrarily.And we know that there were further diplomatic efforts under way. They just decided the time for diplomacy is over and rushed to war without planning for what happens afterwards.Now, he misled the American people in his speech when he said we will plan carefully. They obviously didn\\'t. He misled the American people when he said we\\'d go to war as a last resort. We did not go as a last resort. And most Americans know the difference.Now, this has cost us deeply in the world. I believe that it is important to tell the truth to the American people. I\\'ve worked with those leaders the president talks about, I\\'ve worked with them for 20 years, for longer than this president. And I know what many of them say today, and I know how to bring them back to the table.And I believe that a fresh start, new credibility, a president who can understand what we have to do to reach out to the Muslim world to make it clear that this is not, you know -- Osama bin Laden uses the invasion of Iraq in order to go out to people and say that America has declared war on Islam.We need to be smarter about now we wage a war on terror. We need to deny them the recruits. We need to deny them the safe havens. We need to rebuild our alliances.I believe that Ronald Reagan, John Kennedy, and the others did that more effectively, and I\\'m going to try to follow in their footsteps.LEHRER: Ninety seconds, Mr. President.BUSH: My opponent just said something amazing. He said Osama bin Laden uses the invasion of Iraq as an excuse to spread hatred for America. Osama bin Laden isn\\'t going to determine how we defend ourselves.Osama bin Laden doesn\\'t get to decide. The American people decide.I decided the right action was in Iraq. My opponent calls it a mistake. It wasn\\'t a mistake.He said I misled on Iraq. I don\\'t think he was misleading when he called Iraq a grave threat in the fall of 2002.I don\\'t think he was misleading when he said that it was right to disarm Iraq in the spring of 2003.I don\\'t think he misled you when he said that, you know, anyone who doubted whether the world was better off without Saddam Hussein in power didn\\'t have the judgment to be president. I don\\'t think he was misleading.I think what is misleading is to say you can lead and succeed in Iraq if you keep changing your positions on this war. And he has. As the politics change, his positions change. And that\\'s not how a commander in chief acts.Let me finish.The intelligence I looked at was the same intelligence my opponent looked at, the very same intelligence. And when I stood up there and spoke to the Congress, I was speaking off the same intelligence he looked at to make his decisions to support the authorization of force.LEHRER: Thirty seconds. We\\'ll do a 30 second here.KERRY: I wasn\\'t misleading when I said he was a threat. Nor was I misleading on the day that the president decided to go to war when I said that he had made a mistake in not building strong alliances and that I would have preferred that he did more diplomacy.I\\'ve had one position, one consistent position, that Saddam Hussein was a threat. There was a right way to disarm him and a wrong way. And the president chose the wrong way.LEHRER: Thirty seconds, Mr. President.BUSH: The only thing consistent about my opponent\\'s position is that he\\'s been inconsistent. He changes positions. And you cannot change positions in this war on terror if you expect to win.And I expect to win. It\\'s necessary we win.We\\'re being challenged like never before. And we have a duty to our country and to future generations of America to achieve a free Iraq, a free Afghanistan, and to rid the world of weapons of mass destruction.LEHRER: New question, Mr. President. Two minutes.Has the war in Iraq been worth the cost of American lives, 1,052 as of today?BUSH: You know, every life is precious. Every life matters. You know, my hardest -- the hardest part of the job is to know that I committed the troops in harm\\'s way and then do the best I can to provide comfort for the loved ones who lost a son or a daughter or a husband or wife.You know, I think about Missy Johnson. She\\'s a fantastic lady I met in Charlotte, North Carolina. She and her son Bryan, they came to see me. Her husband PJ got killed. He\\'d been in Afghanistan, went to Iraq.You know, it\\'s hard work to try to love her as best as I can, knowing full well that the decision I made caused her loved one to be in harm\\'s way.I told her after we prayed and teared up and laughed some that I thought her husband\\'s sacrifice was noble and worthy. Because I understand the stakes of this war on terror. I understand that we must find Al Qaida wherever they hide.We must deal with threats before they fully materialize. And Saddam Hussein was a threat, and that we must spread liberty because in the long run, the way to defeat hatred and tyranny and oppression is to spread freedom.Missy understood that. That\\'s what she told me her husband understood. So you say, \"Was it worth it?\" Every life is precious. That\\'s what distinguishes us from the enemy. Everybody matters. But I think it\\'s worth it, Jim.I think it\\'s worth it, because I think -- I know in the long term a free Iraq, a free Afghanistan, will set such a powerful example in a part of the world that\\'s desperate for freedom. It will help change the world; that we can look back and say we did our duty.LEHRER: Senator, 90 seconds.KERRY: I understand what the president is talking about, because I know what it means to lose people in combat. And the question, is it worth the cost, reminds me of my own thinking when I came back from fighting in that war.And it reminds me that it is vital for us not to confuse the war, ever, with the warriors. That happened before.And that\\'s one of the reasons why I believe I can get this job done, because I am determined for those soldiers and for those families, for those kids who put their lives on the line.That is noble. That\\'s the most noble thing that anybody can do. And I want to make sure the outcome honors that nobility.Now, we have a choice here. I\\'ve laid out a plan by which I think we can be successful in Iraq: with a summit, by doing better training, faster, by cutting -- by doing what we need to do with respect to the U.N. and the elections.There\\'s only 25 percent of the people in there. They can\\'t have an election right now.The president\\'s not getting the job done.So the choice for America is, you can have a plan that I\\'ve laid out in four points, each of which I can tell you more about or you can go to johnkerry.com and see more of it; or you have the president\\'s plan, which is four words: more of the same.I think my plan is better.And my plan has a better chance of standing up and fighting for those troops.I will never let those troops down, and will hunt and kill the terrorists wherever they are.LEHRER: All right, sir, go ahead. Thirty seconds.BUSH: Yes, I understand what it means to the commander in chief. And if I were to ever say, \"This is the wrong war at the wrong time at the wrong place,\" the troops would wonder, how can I follow this guy?You cannot lead the war on terror if you keep changing positions on the war on terror and say things like, \"Well, this is just a grand diversion.\" It\\'s not a grand diversion. This is an essential that we get it right.And so, the plan he talks about simply won\\'t work.LEHRER: Senator Kerry, you have 30 seconds. You have 30 seconds, right. And then the president.KERRY: Secretary of State Colin Powell told this president the Pottery Barn rule: If you break it, you fix it.Now, if you break it, you made a mistake. It\\'s the wrong thing to do. But you own it. And then you\\'ve got to fix it and do something with it.Now that\\'s what we have to do. There\\'s no inconsistency. Soldiers know over there that this isn\\'t being done right yet. I\\'m going to get it right for those soldiers, because it\\'s important to Israel, it\\'s important to America, it\\'s important to the world, it\\'s important to the fight on terror.But I have a plan to do it. He doesn\\'t.LEHRER: Speaking of your plan, new question, Senator Kerry. Two minutes.Can you give us specifics, in terms of a scenario, time lines, et cetera, for ending major U.S. military involvement in Iraq?KERRY: The time line that I\\'ve set out -- and again, I want to correct the president, because he\\'s misled again this evening on what I\\'ve said. I didn\\'t say I would bring troops out in six months. I said, if we do the things that I\\'ve set out and we are successful, we could begin to draw the troops down in six months.And I think a critical component of success in Iraq is being able to convince the Iraqis and the Arab world that the United States doesn\\'t have long-term designs on it.As I understand it, we\\'re building some 14 military bases there now, and some people say they\\'ve got a rather permanent concept to them.When you guard the oil ministry, but you don\\'t guard the nuclear facilities, the message to a lot of people is maybe, \"Wow, maybe they\\'re interested in our oil.\"Now, the problem is that they didn\\'t think these things through properly. And these are the things you have to think through.What I want to do is change the dynamics on the ground. And you have to do that by beginning to not back off of the Fallujahs and other places, and send the wrong message to the terrorists. You have to close the borders.You\\'ve got to show you\\'re serious in that regard. But you\\'ve also got to show that you are prepared to bring the rest of the world in and share the stakes.I will make a flat statement: The United States of America has no long-term designs on staying in Iraq.And our goal in my administration would be to get all of the troops out of there with a minimal amount you need for training and logistics as we do in some other countries in the world after a war to be able to sustain the peace.But that\\'s how we\\'re going to win the peace, by rapidly training the Iraqis themselves.Even the administration has admitted they haven\\'t done the training, because they came back to Congress a few weeks ago and asked for a complete reprogramming of the money.Now what greater admission is there, 16 months afterwards. \"Oops, we haven\\'t done the job. We have to start to spend the money now. Will you guys give us permission to shift it over into training?\"LEHRER: Ninety seconds.BUSH: There are 100,000 troops trained, police, guard, special units, border patrol. There\\'s going to be 125,000 trained by the end of this year. Yes, we\\'re getting the job done. It\\'s hard work. Everybody knows it\\'s hard work, because there\\'s a determined enemy that\\'s trying to defeat us.Now, my opponent says he\\'s going to try to change the dynamics on the ground. Well, Prime Minister Allawi was here. He is the leader of that country. He\\'s a brave, brave man. When he came, after giving a speech to the Congress, my opponent questioned his credibility.You can\\'t change the dynamics on the ground if you\\'ve criticized the brave leader of Iraq.One of his campaign people alleged that Prime Minister Allawi was like a puppet. That\\'s no way to treat somebody who\\'s courageous and brave, that is trying to lead his country forward.The way to make sure that we succeed is to send consistent, sound messages to the Iraqi people that when we give our word, we will keep our word, that we stand with you, that we believe you want to be free. And I do.I believe that 25 million people, the vast majority, long to have elections.I reject this notion -- and I\\'m suggesting my opponent isn\\'t -- I reject the notion that some say that if you\\'re Muslim you can\\'t free, you don\\'t desire freedom. I disagree, strongly disagree with that.LEHRER: Thirty seconds.KERRY: I couldn\\'t agree more that the Iraqis want to be free and that they could be free.But I think the president, again, still hasn\\'t shown how he\\'s going to go about it the right way. He has more of the same.Now, Prime Minister Allawi came here, and he said the terrorists are pouring over the border. That\\'s Allawi\\'s assessment.The national intelligence assessment that was given to the president in July said, best-case scenario, more of the same of what we see today; worst-case scenario, civil war.I can do better.BUSH: Yes, let me...LEHRER: Yes, 30 seconds.BUSH: The reason why Prime Minister Allawi said they\\'re coming across the border is because he recognizes that this is a central part of the war on terror. They\\'re fighting us because they\\'re fighting freedom.They understand that a free Afghanistan or a free Iraq will be a major defeat for them. And those are the stakes.And that\\'s why it is essential we not leave. That\\'s why it\\'s essential we hold the line. That\\'s why it\\'s essential we win. And we will. Under my leadership we\\'re going to win this war in Iraq.LEHRER: Mr. President, new question. Two minutes. Does the Iraq experience make it more likely or less likely that you would take the United States into another preemptive military action?BUSH: I would hope I never have to. I understand how hard it is to commit troops. Never wanted to commit troops. When I was running -- when we had the debate in 2000, never dreamt I\\'d be doing that.But the enemy attacked us, Jim, and I have a solemn duty to protect the American people, to do everything I can to protect us.I think that by speaking clearly and doing what we say and not sending mixed messages, it is less likely we\\'ll ever have to use troops.But a president must always be willing to use troops. It must -- as a last resort.I was hopeful diplomacy would work in Iraq. It was falling apart. There was no doubt in my mind that Saddam Hussein was hoping that the world would turn a blind eye.And if he had been in power, in other words, if we would have said, \"Let the inspectors work, or let\\'s, you know, hope to talk him out. Maybe an 18th resolution would work,\" he would have been stronger and tougher, and the world would have been a lot worse off. There\\'s just no doubt in my mind we would rue the day, had Saddam Hussein been in power.So we use diplomacy every chance we get, believe me. And I would hope to never have to use force.But by speaking clearly and sending messages that we mean what we say, we\\'ve affected the world in a positive way.Look at Libya. Libya was a threat. Libya is now peacefully dismantling its weapons programs.Libya understood that America and others will enforce doctrine and that the world is better for it.So to answer your question, I would hope we never have to. I think by acting firmly and decisively, it will mean it is less likely we have to use force.LEHRER: Senator Kerry, 90 seconds.KERRY: Jim, the president just said something extraordinarily revealing and frankly very important in this debate. In answer to your question about Iraq and sending people into Iraq, he just said, \"The enemy attacked us.\"Saddam Hussein didn\\'t attack us. Osama bin Laden attacked us. Al Qaida attacked us. And when we had Osama bin Laden cornered in the mountains of Tora Bora, 1,000 of his cohorts with him in those mountains. With the American military forces nearby and in the field, we didn\\'t use the best trained troops in the world to go kill the world\\'s number one criminal and terrorist.They outsourced the job to Afghan warlords, who only a week earlier had been on the other side fighting against us, neither of whom trusted each other.That\\'s the enemy that attacked us. That\\'s the enemy that was allowed to walk out of those mountains. That\\'s the enemy that is now in 60 countries, with stronger recruits.He also said Saddam Hussein would have been stronger. That is just factually incorrect. Two-thirds of the country was a no-fly zone when we started this war. We would have had sanctions. We would have had the U.N. inspectors. Saddam Hussein would have been continually weakening.If the president had shown the patience to go through another round of resolution, to sit down with those leaders, say, \"What do you need, what do you need now, how much more will it take to get you to join us?\" we\\'d be in a stronger place today.LEHRER: Thirty seconds.BUSH: First of all, of course I know Osama bin Laden attacked us. I know that.And secondly, to think that another round of resolutions would have caused Saddam Hussein to disarm, disclose, is ludicrous, in my judgment. It just shows a significant difference of opinion.We tried diplomacy. We did our best. He was hoping to turn a blind eye. And, yes, he would have been stronger had we not dealt with him. He had the capability of making weapons, and he would have made weapons.LEHRER: Thirty seconds, Senator.KERRY: Thirty-five to forty countries in the world had a greater capability of making weapons at the moment the president invaded than Saddam Hussein. And while he\\'s been diverted, with 9 out of 10 active duty divisions of our Army, either going to Iraq, coming back from Iraq, or getting ready to go, North Korea\\'s gotten nuclear weapons and the world is more dangerous. Iran is moving toward nuclear weapons and the world is more dangerous. Darfur has a genocide.The world is more dangerous. I\\'d have made a better choice.LEHRER: New question. Two minutes, Senator Kerry.What is your position on the whole concept of preemptive war? KERRY: The president always has the right, and always has had the right, for preemptive strike. That was a great doctrine throughout the Cold War. And it was always one of the things we argued about with respect to arms control.No president, through all of American history, has ever ceded, and nor would I, the right to preempt in any way necessary to protect the United States of America.But if and when you do it, Jim, you have to do it in a way that passes the test, that passes the global test where your countrymen, your people understand fully why you\\'re doing what you\\'re doing and you can prove to the world that you did it for legitimate reasons.Here we have our own secretary of state who has had to apologize to the world for the presentation he made to the United Nations.I mean, we can remember when President Kennedy in the Cuban missile crisis sent his secretary of state to Paris to meet with DeGaulle. And in the middle of the discussion, to tell them about the missiles in Cuba, he said, \"Here, let me show you the photos.\" And DeGaulle waved them off and said, \"No, no, no, no. The word of the president of the United States is good enough for me.\"How many leaders in the world today would respond to us, as a result of what we\\'ve done, in that way? So what is at test here is the credibility of the United States of America and how we lead the world. And Iran and Iraq are now more dangerous -- Iran and North Korea are now more dangerous.Now, whether preemption is ultimately what has to happen, I don\\'t know yet. But I\\'ll tell you this: As president, I\\'ll never take my eye off that ball. I\\'ve been fighting for proliferation the entire time -- anti-proliferation the entire time I\\'ve been in the Congress. And we\\'ve watched this president actually turn away from some of the treaties that were on the table.You don\\'t help yourself with other nations when you turn away from the global warming treaty, for instance, or when you refuse to deal at length with the United Nations.You have to earn that respect. And I think we have a lot of earning back to do.LEHRER: Ninety seconds.BUSH: Let me -- I\\'m not exactly sure what you mean, \"passes the global test,\" you take preemptive action if you pass a global test.My attitude is you take preemptive action in order to protect the American people, that you act in order to make this country secure.My opponent talks about me not signing certain treaties. Let me tell you one thing I didn\\'t sign, and I think it shows the difference of our opinion -- the difference of opinions. And that is, I wouldn\\'t join the International Criminal Court. This is a body based in The Hague where unaccountable judges and prosecutors can pull our troops or diplomats up for trial.And I wouldn\\'t join it. And I understand that in certain capitals around the world that that wasn\\'t a popular move. But it\\'s the right move not to join a foreign court that could -- where our people could be prosecuted.My opponent is for joining the International Criminal Court. I just think trying to be popular, kind of, in the global sense, if it\\'s not in our best interest makes no sense. I\\'m interested in working with our nations and do a lot of it. But I\\'m not going to make decisions that I think are wrong for America.LEHRER: New question, Mr. President. Do you believe that diplomacy and sanctions can resolve the nuclear problems with North Korea and Iran? Take them in any order you would like.BUSH: North Korea, first, I do. Let me say -- I certainly hope so. Before I was sworn in, the policy of this government was to have bilateral negotiations with North Korea.And we signed an agreement with North Korea that my administration found out that was not being honored by the North Koreans.And so I decided that a better way to approach the issue was to get other nations involved, just besides us. And in Crawford, Texas, Jiang Zemin and I agreed that the nuclear-weapons-free peninsula, Korean Peninsula, was in his interest and our interest and the world\\'s interest.And so we began a new dialogue with North Korea, one that included not only the United States, but now China. And China\\'s a got a lot of influence over North Korea, some ways more than we do.As well, we included South Korea, Japan and Russia. So now there are five voices speaking to Kim Jong Il, not just one.And so if Kim Jong Il decides again to not honor an agreement, he\\'s not only doing injustice to America, he\\'d be doing injustice to China, as well.And I think this will work. It\\'s not going to work if we open up a dialogue with Kim Jong Il. Thatâ€™s what he wants. He wants to unravel the six- party talks, or the five-nation coalition that\\'s sending him a clear message.On Iran, I hope we can do the same thing, continue to work with the world to convince the Iranian mullahs to abandon their nuclear ambitions.We worked very closely with the foreign ministers of France, Germany and Great Britain, who have been the folks delivering the message to the mullahs that if you expect to be part of the world of nations, get rid of your nuclear programs.The IAEA is involved. There\\'s a special protocol recently been passed that allows for inspections.I hope we can do it. And we\\'ve got a good strategy.LEHRER: Senator Kerry, 90 seconds.KERRY: With respect to Iran, the British, French, and Germans were the ones who initiated an effort without the United States, regrettably, to begin to try to move to curb the nuclear possibilities in Iran. I believe we could have done better. I think the United States should have offered the opportunity to provide the nuclear fuel, test them, see whether or not they were actually looking for it for peaceful purposes. If they weren\\'t willing to work a deal, then we could have put sanctions together. The president did nothing.With respect to North Korea, the real story: We had inspectors and television cameras in the nuclear reactor in North Korea. Secretary Bill Perry negotiated that under President Clinton. And we knew where the fuel rods were. And we knew the limits on their nuclear power.Colin Powell, our secretary of state, announced one day that we were going to continue the dialog of working with the North Koreans. The president reversed it publicly while the president of South Korea was here.And the president of South Korea went back to South Korea bewildered and embarrassed because it went against his policy. And for two years, this administration didn\\'t talk at all to North Korea.While they didn\\'t talk at all, the fuel rods came out, the inspectors were kicked out, the television cameras were kicked out. And today, there are four to seven nuclear weapons in the hands of North Korea.That happened on this president\\'s watch.Now, that, I think, is one of the most serious, sort of, reversals or mixed messages that you could possibly send.LEHRER: I want to make sure -- yes, sir -- but in this one minute, I want to make sure that we understand -- the people watching understand the differences between the two of you on this.You want to continue the multinational talks, correct?BUSH: Right.LEHRER: And you\\'re willing to do it...KERRY: Both. I want bilateral talks which put all of the issues, from the armistice of 1952, the economic issues, the human rights issues, the artillery disposal issues, the DMZ issues and the nuclear issues on the table.LEHRER: And you\\'re opposed to that. Right?BUSH: The minute we have bilateral talks, the six-party talks will unwind. That\\'s exactly what Kim Jong Il wants. And by the way, the breach on the agreement was not through plutonium. The breach on the agreement is highly enriched uranium. That\\'s what we caught him doing. That\\'s where he was breaking the agreement.Secondly, he said -- my opponent said where he worked to put sanctions on Iran -- we\\'ve already sanctioned Iran. We can\\'t sanction them any more. There are sanctions in place on Iran.And finally, we were a party to the convention -- to working with Germany, France and Great Britain to send their foreign ministers into Iran.LEHRER: New question, two minutes.Senator Kerry, you mentioned Darfur, the Darfur region of Sudan. Fifty thousand people have already died in that area. More than a million are homeless. And it\\'s been labeled an act of ongoing genocide. Yet neither one of you or anyone else connected with your campaigns or your administration that I can find has discussed the possibility of sending in troops.Why not?KERRY: Well, I\\'ll tell you exactly why not, but I first want to say something about those sanctions on Iran.Only the United States put the sanctions on alone, and that\\'s exactly what I\\'m talking about.In order for the sanctions to be effective, we should have been working with the British, French and Germans and other countries. And that\\'s the difference between the president and me.And there, again, he sort of slid by the question.Now, with respect to Darfur, yes, it is a genocide. And months ago, many of us were pressing for action.I think the reason that we\\'re not saying send American troops in at this point is severalfold.Number one, we can do this through the African Union, providing we give them the logistical support. Right now all the president is providing is humanitarian support. We need to do more than that. They\\'ve got to have the logistical capacity to go in and stop the killing. And that\\'s going to require more than is on the table today.I also believe that it is -- one of the reasons we can\\'t do it is we\\'re overextended.Ask the people in the armed forces today. We\\'ve got Guards and Reserves who are doing double duties. We\\'ve got a backdoor draft taking place in America today: people with stop-loss programs where they\\'re told you can\\'t get out of the military; nine out of our 10 active duty divisions committed to Iraq one way or the other, either going, coming or preparing.So this is the way the president has overextended the United States.That\\'s why, in my plan, I add two active duty divisions to the United States Army, not for Iraq, but for our general demands across the globe. I also intend to double the number of special forces so that we can do the job we need to do with respect fighting the terrorists around the world. And if we do that, then we have the ability to be able to respond more rapidly.But I\\'ll tell you this, as president, if it took American forces to some degree to coalesce the African Union, I\\'d be prepared to do it because we could never allow another Rwanda.It\\'s a moral responsibility for us and the world.LEHRER: Ninety seconds.BUSH: Back to Iran, just for a second.It was not my administration that put the sanctions on Iran. That happened long before I arrived in Washington, D.C.In terms of Darfur, I agree it\\'s genocide. And Colin Powell so stated.We have committed $200 million worth of aid. We\\'re the leading donor in the world to help the suffering people there. We will commit more over time to help.We were very much involved at the U.N. on the sanction policy of the Bashir government in the Sudan. Prior to Darfur, Ambassador Jack Danforth had been negotiating a north-south agreement that we would have hoped would have brought peace to the Sudan.I agree with my opponent that we shouldn\\'t be committing troops. We ought to be working with the African Union to do so -- precisely what we did in Liberia. We helped stabilize the situation with some troops, and when the African Union came, we moved them out.My hope is that the African Union moves rapidly to help save lives. And fortunately the rainy season will be ending shortly, which will make it easier to get aid there and help the long-suffering people there.LEHRER: New question, President Bush. Clearly, as we have heard, major policy differences between the two of you. Are there also underlying character issues that you believe, that you believe are serious enough to deny Senator Kerry the job as commander in chief of the United States?BUSH: That\\'s a loaded question. Well, first of all, I admire Senator Kerry\\'s service to our country. I admire the fact that he is a great dad. I appreciate the fact that his daughters have been so kind to my daughters in what has been a pretty hard experience for, I guess, young girls, seeing their dads out there campaigning.I admire the fact that he served for 20 years in the Senate. Although I\\'m not so sure I admire the record.I won\\'t hold it against him that he went to Yale. There\\'s nothing wrong with that.My concerns about the senator is that, in the course of this campaign, I\\'ve been listening very carefully to what he says, and he changes positions on the war in Iraq. He changes positions on something as fundamental as what you believe in your core, in your heart of hearts, is right in Iraq.You cannot lead if you send mixed messages. Mixed messages send the wrong signals to our troops. Mixed messages send the wrong signals to our allies. Mixed messages send the wrong signals to the Iraqi citizens.And that\\'s my biggest concern about my opponent. I admire his service. But I just know how this world works, and that in the councils of government, there must be certainty from the U.S. president.Of course, we change tactics when need to, but we never change our beliefs, the strategic beliefs that are necessary to protect this country in the world.LEHRER: Ninety second response, Senator.KERRY: Well, first of all, I appreciate enormously the personal comments the president just made. And I share them with him. I think only if you\\'re doing this -- and he\\'s done it more than I have in terms of the presidency -- can you begin to get a sense of what it means to your families. And it\\'s tough. And so I acknowledge that his daughters -- I\\'ve watched them.I\\'ve chuckled a few times at some of their comments.(LAUGHTER)And...BUSH: I\\'m trying to put a leash on them.(LAUGHTER)KERRY: Well, I know. I\\'ve learned not to do that.(LAUGHTER)And I have great respect and admiration for his wife. I think she\\'s a terrific person...BUSH: Thank you.KERRY: ... and a great first lady.But we do have differences. I\\'m not going to talk about a difference of character. I don\\'t think that\\'s my job or my business.But let me talk about something that the president just sort of finished up with. Maybe someone would call it a character trait, maybe somebody wouldn\\'t.But this issue of certainty. It\\'s one thing to be certain, but you can be certain and be wrong.It\\'s another to be certain and be right, or to be certain and be moving in the right direction, or be certain about a principle and then learn new facts and take those new facts and put them to use in order to change and get your policy right.What I worry about with the president is that he\\'s not acknowledging what\\'s on the ground, he\\'s not acknowledging the realities of North Korea, he\\'s not acknowledging the truth of the science of stem-cell research or of global warming and other issues.And certainty sometimes can get you in trouble.LEHRER: Thirty seconds.BUSH: Well, I think -- listen, I fully agree that one should shift tactics, and we will, in Iraq. Our commanders have got all the flexibility to do what is necessary to succeed.But what I won\\'t do is change my core values because of politics or because of pressure.And it is one of the things I\\'ve learned in the White House, is that there\\'s enormous pressure on the president, and he cannot wilt under that pressure. Otherwise, the world won\\'t be better off.LEHRER: Thirty seconds.KERRY: I have no intention of wilting. I\\'ve never wilted in my life. And I\\'ve never wavered in my life.I know exactly what we need to do in Iraq, and my position has been consistent: Saddam Hussein is a threat. He needed to be disarmed. We needed to go to the U.N. The president needed the authority to use force in order to be able to get him to do something, because he never did it without the threat of force.But we didn\\'t need to rush to war without a plan to win the peace.LEHRER: New question, two minutes, Senator Kerry.If you are elected president, what will you take to that office thinking is the single most serious threat to the national security to the United States?KERRY: Nuclear proliferation. Nuclear proliferation. There\\'s some 600-plus tons of unsecured material still in the former Soviet Union and Russia. At the rate that the president is currently securing it, it\\'ll take 13 years to get it.I did a lot of work on this. I wrote a book about it several years ago -- six, seven years ago -- called \"The New War,\" which saw the difficulties of this international criminal network. And back then, we intercepted a suitcase in a Middle Eastern country with nuclear materials in it. And the black market sale price was about $250 million.Now, there are terrorists trying to get their hands on that stuff today.And this president, I regret to say, has secured less nuclear material in the last two years since 9/11 than we did in the two years preceding 9/11.We have to do this job. And to do the job, you can\\'t cut the money for it. The president actually cut the money for it. You have to put the money into it and the funding and the leadership.And part of that leadership is sending the right message to places like North Korea.Right now the president is spending hundreds of millions of dollars to research bunker-busting nuclear weapons. The United States is pursuing a new set of nuclear weapons. It doesn\\'t make sense.You talk about mixed messages. We\\'re telling other people, \"You can\\'t have nuclear weapons,\" but we\\'re pursuing a new nuclear weapon that we might even contemplate using.Not this president. I\\'m going to shut that program down, and we\\'re going to make it clear to the world we\\'re serious about containing nuclear proliferation.And we\\'re going to get the job of containing all of that nuclear material in Russia done in four years. And we\\'re going to build the strongest international network to prevent nuclear proliferation.This is the scale of what President Kennedy set out to do with the nuclear test ban treaty. It\\'s our generation\\'s equivalent. And I intend to get it done.LEHRER: Ninety seconds, Mr. President.BUSH: Actually, we\\'ve increased funding for dealing with nuclear proliferation about 35 percent since I\\'ve been the president. Secondly, we\\'ve set up what\\'s called the -- well, first of all, I agree with my opponent that the biggest threat facing this country is weapons of mass destruction in the hands of a terrorist network. And that\\'s why proliferation is one of the centerpieces of a multi-prong strategy to make the country safer.My administration started what\\'s called the Proliferation Security Initiative. Over 60 nations involved with disrupting the trans-shipment of information and/or weapons of mass destruction materials.And we\\'ve been effective. We busted the A.Q. Khan network. This was a proliferator out of Pakistan that was selling secrets to places like North Korea and Libya. We convinced Libya to disarm. It\\'s a central part of dealing with weapons of mass destruction and proliferation.I\\'ll tell you another way to help protect America in the long run is to continue with missile defenses. And we\\'ve got a robust research and development program that has been ongoing during my administration. We\\'ll be implementing a missile-defense system relatively quickly.And that is another way to help deal with the threats that we face in the 21st century.My opponent opposed the missile defenses.LEHRER: Just for this one-minute discussion here, just for whatever seconds it takes: So it\\'s correct to say, that if somebody is listening to this, that both of you agree, if you\\'re reelected, Mr. President, and if you are elected, the single most serious threat you believe, both of you believe, is nuclear proliferation?BUSH: In the hands of a terrorist enemy.KERRY: Weapons of mass destruction, nuclear proliferation.But again, the test or the difference between us, the president has had four years to try to do something about it, and North Korea has got more weapons; Iran is moving towards weapons. And at his pace, it will take 13 years to secure those weapons in Russia.I\\'m going to do it in four years, and I\\'m going to immediately set out to have bilateral talks with North Korea.LEHRER: Your response to that?BUSH: Again, I can\\'t tell you how big a mistake I think that is, to have bilateral talks with North Korea. It\\'s precisely what Kim Jong Il wants. It will cause the six-party talks to evaporate. It will mean that China no longer is involved in convincing, along with us, for Kim Jong Il to get rid of his weapons. It\\'s a big mistake to do that.We must have China\\'s leverage on Kim Jong Il, besides ourselves.And if you enter bilateral talks, they\\'ll be happy to walk away from the table. I don\\'t think that\\'ll work.LEHRER: All right. Mr. President, this is the last question. And two minutes. It\\'s a new subject -- new question, and it has to do with President Putin and Russia. Did you misjudge him or are you -- do you feel that what he is doing in the name of antiterrorism by changing some democratic processes is OK?BUSH: No, I don\\'t think it\\'s OK, and said so publicly. I think that there needs to be checks and balances in a democracy, and made that very clear that by consolidating power in the central government, he\\'s sending a signal to the Western world and United States that perhaps he doesn\\'t believe in checks and balances, and I told him that.I mean, he\\'s also a strong ally in the war on terror. He is -- listen, they went through a horrible situation in Beslan, where these terrorists gunned down young school kids. That\\'s the nature of the enemy, by the way. That\\'s why we need to be firm and resolved in bringing them to justice.That\\'s precisely what Vladimir Putin understands, as well.I\\'ve got a good relation with Vladimir. And it\\'s important that we do have a good relation, because that enables me to better comment to him, and to better to discuss with him, some of the decisions he makes. I found that, in this world, that it\\'s important to establish good personal relationships with people so that when you have disagreements, you\\'re able to disagree in a way that is effective.And so I\\'ve told him my opinion.I look forward to discussing it more with him, as time goes on. Russia is a country in transition. Vladimir is going to have to make some hard choices. And I think it\\'s very important for the American president, as well as other Western leaders, to remind him of the great benefits of democracy, that democracy will best help the people realize their hopes and aspirations and dreams. And I will continue working with him over the next four years.LEHRER: Ninety seconds, Senator Kerry.KERRY: Well, let me just say quickly that I\\'ve had an extraordinary experience of watching up close and personal that transition in Russia, because I was there right after the transformation. And I was probably one of the first senators, along with Senator Bob Smith of New Hampshire, a former senator, to go down into the KGB underneath Treblinka Square and see reams of files with names in them.It sort of brought home the transition to democracy that Russia was trying to make.I regret what\\'s happened in these past months. And I think it goes beyond just the response to terror. Mr. Putin now controls all the television stations. His political opposition is being put in jail.And I think it\\'s very important to the United States, obviously, to have a working relationship that is good. This is a very important country to us. We want a partnership.But we always have to stand up for democracy. As George Will said the other day, \"Freedom on the march; not in Russia right now.\"Now, I\\'d like to come back for a quick moment, if I can, to that issue about China and the talks. Because that\\'s one of the most critical issues here: North Korea.Just because the president says it can\\'t be done, that you\\'d lose China, doesn\\'t mean it can\\'t be done. I mean, this is the president who said \"There were weapons of mass destruction,\" said \"Mission accomplished,\" said we could fight the war on the cheap -- none of which were true.We could have bilateral talks with Kim Jong Il. And we can get those weapons at the same time as we get China. Because China has an interest in the outcome, too.LEHRER: Thirty seconds, Mr. President.BUSH: You know my opinion on North Korea. I can\\'t say it any more plainly.LEHRER: Well, but when he used the word \"truth\" again...BUSH: Pardon me?LEHRER: ... talking about the truth of the matter. He used the word \"truth\" again. Did that raise any hackles with you?BUSH: Oh, I\\'m a pretty calm guy. I don\\'t take it personally.LEHRER: OK. All right.BUSH: You know, we looked at the same intelligence and came to the same conclusion: that Saddam Hussein was a grave threat.And I don\\'t hold it against him that he said grave threat. I\\'m not going to go around the country saying he didn\\'t tell the truth, when he looked at the same intelligence I did.KERRY: It was a threat. That\\'s not the issue. The issue is what you do about it.The president said he was going to build a true coalition, exhaust the remedies of the U.N. and go to war as a last resort.Those words really have to mean something. And, unfortunately, he didn\\'t go to war as a last resort.Now we have this incredible mess in Iraq -- $200 billion. It\\'s not what the American people thought they were getting when they voted.LEHRER: All right, that brings us to closing statements.And, again, as determined by a coin toss, Senator Kerry, you go first, and you have two minutes.KERRY: Thank you, Jim, very much.Thank you very much to the university, again.Thank you, Mr. President.My fellow Americans, as I\\'ve said at the very beginning of this debate, both President Bush and I love this country very much. There\\'s no doubt, I think, about that.But we have a different set of convictions about how we make our country stronger here at home and respected again in the world.I know that for many of you sitting at home, parents of kids in Iraq, you want to know who\\'s the person who could be a commander in chief who could get your kids home and get the job done and win the peace.And for all the rest of the parents in America who are wondering about their kids going to the school or anywhere else in the world, what kind of world they\\'re going to grow up in, let me look you in the eye and say to you: I defended this country as a young man in war, and I will defend it as president of the United States.But I have a difference with this president. I believe when we\\'re strongest when we reach out and lead the world and build strong alliances.I have a plan for Iraq. I believe we can be successful. I\\'m not talking about leaving. I\\'m talking about winning. And we need a fresh start, a new credibility, a president who can bring allies to our side.I also have a plan to win the war on terror, funding homeland security, strengthening our military, cutting our finances, reaching out to the world, again building strong alliances.I believe America\\'s best days are ahead of us because I believe that the future belongs to freedom, not to fear.That\\'s the country that I\\'m going to fight for. And I ask you to give me the opportunity to make you proud. I ask you to give me the opportunity to lead this great nation, so that we can be stronger here at home, respected again in the world, and have responsible leadership that we deserve.Thank you. And God bless America.LEHRER: Mr. President, two minutes.BUSH: Thank you very much tonight, Jim. Senator.If America shows uncertainty or weakness in this decade, the world will drift toward tragedy. That\\'s not going to happen, so long as I\\'m your president.The next four years we will continue to strengthen our homeland defenses. We will strengthen our intelligence-gathering services. We will reform our military. The military will be an all-volunteer army.We will continue to stay on the offense. We will fight the terrorists around the world so we do not have to face them here at home.We\\'ll continue to build our alliances. I\\'ll never turn over America\\'s national security needs to leaders of other countries, as we continue to build those alliances. And we\\'ll continue to spread freedom. I believe in the transformational power of liberty. I believe that the free Iraq is in this nation\\'s interests. I believe a free Afghanistan is in this nation\\'s interest.And I believe both a free Afghanistan and a free Iraq will serve as a powerful example for millions who plead in silence for liberty in the broader Middle East.We\\'ve done a lot of hard work together over the last three and a half years. We\\'ve been challenged, and we\\'ve risen to those challenges. We\\'ve climbed the mighty mountain. I see the valley below, and it\\'s a valley of peace.By being steadfast and resolute and strong, by keeping our word, by supporting our troops, we can achieve the peace we all want.I appreciate your listening tonight. I ask for your vote. And may God continue to bless our great land.LEHRER: And that ends tonight\\'s debate. A reminder, the second presidential debate will be a week from tomorrow, October 8th, from Washington University in St. Louis. Charles Gibson of ABC News will moderate a town hall-type event. Then, on October 13th, from Arizona State University in Tempe, Bob Schieffer of CBS News will moderate an exchange on domestic policy that will be similar in format to tonight\\'s.Also, this coming Tuesday, at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, the vice presidential candidates, Vice President Cheney and Senator Edwards, will debate with my PBS colleague, Gwen Ifill, moderating.For now, thank you, Senator Kerry, President Bush.From Coral Gables, Florida, I\\'m Jim Lehrer. Thank you and good night.(APPLAUSE)',\n",
       " 'October 3, 2000 TranscriptOctober 3, 2000The First Gore-Bush Presidential DebateMODERATOR: Good evening from the Clark Athletic Center at the University of Massachusetts in Boston. I\\'m Jim Lehrer of the NewsHour on PBS, and I welcome you to the first of three 90-minute debates between the Democratic candidate for president, Vice President Al Gore and the Republican candidate, Governor George W. Bush of Texas. The debates are sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates and they will be conducted within formats and rules agreed to between the commission and the two campaigns. We\\'ll have the candidates at podiums. No answer to a question can exceed two minutes. Rebuttal is limited to one minute. But as moderator I have the option to follow up and to extend any particular give and take another three-and-a-half minutes. Even then, no single answer can exceed two minutes. The candidates under their rules may not question each other directly. There will be no opening statements, but each candidate may have up to two minutes for a closing statement. The questions and the subjects were chosen by me alone. I have told no one from the two campaigns, or the Commission, or anyone else involved what they are. There is a small audience in the hall tonight. They are not here to participate, only to listen. I have asked, and they have agreed, to remain silent for the next 90 minutes. Except for right now, when they will applaud as we welcome the two candidates, Governor Bush and Vice President Gore.(Applause)MODERATOR: And now the first question as determined by a flip of a coin, it goes to Vice President Gore. Vice President Gore, you have questioned whether Governor Bush has the experience to be President of the United States. What exactly do you mean?GORE: Well, Jim, first of all, I would like to thank the sponsors of this debate and the people of Boston for hosting the debate. I would like to thank Governor Bush for participating, and I would like to say I\\'m happy to be here with Tipper and our family. I have actually not questioned Governor Bush\\'s experience. I have questioned his proposals. And here is why. I think this is a very important moment for our country. We have achieved extraordinary prosperity. And in this election, America has to make an important choice. Will we use our prosperity to enrich not just the few, but all of our families? I believe we have to make the right and responsible choices. If I\\'m entrusted with the presidency, here are the choices that I will make. I will balance the budget every year. I will pay down the national debt. I will put Medicare and Social Security in a lockbox and protect them. And I will cut taxes for middle-class families. I believe it\\'s important to resist the temptation to squander our surplus. If we make the right choices, we can have a prosperity that endures and enriches all of our people. If I\\'m entrusted with the presidency, I will help parents and strengthen families because, you know, if we have prosperity that grows and grows, we still won\\'t be successful unless we strengthen families by, for example, ensuring that children can always go to schools that are safe. By giving parents the tools to protect their children against cultural pollution. I will make sure that we invest in our country and our families. And I mean investing in education, health care, the environment, and middle-class tax cuts and retirement security. That is my agenda and that is why I think that it\\'s not just a question of experience.MODERATOR: Governor Bush, one minute rebuttal.BUSH: Well, we do come from different places. I come from West Texas. The governor is the chief executive officer. We know how to set agendas. I think you\\'ll find the difference reflected in our budgets. I want to take one-half of the surplus and dedicate it to Social Security. One-quarter of the surplus for important projects, and I want to send one-quarter of the surplus back to the people who pay the bills. I want everybody who pays taxes to have their tax rates cut. And that stands in contrast to my worthy opponent\\'s plan, which will increase the size of government dramatically. His plan is three times larger than President Clinton\\'s proposed plan eight years ago. It is a plan that will have 200 new programs -- expanded programs and creates 20,000 new bureaucrats. It it empowers Washington. Tonight youâ€™re going to hear that my passion and my vision is to empower Americans to be able to make decisions for themselves in their own lives.MODERATOR: So I take it by your answer, then, Mr. Vice President, that in an interview recently with the \"New York Times\" when you said that you questioned whether or not Governor Bush has experience enough to be president, you were talking about strictly policy differences.GORE: Yes, Jim. I said that his tax cut plan, for example, raises the question of whether it\\'s the right choice for the country. And let me give you an example of what I mean. Under Governor Bush\\'s tax cut proposal, he would spend more money on tax cuts for the wealthiest 1% than all of the new spending that he proposes for education, health care, prescription drugs and national defense all combined. Now, I think those are the wrong priorities. Now, under my proposal, for every dollar that I propose in spending for things like education and health care, I will put another dollar into middle class tax cuts. And for every dollar that I spend in those two categories, I\\'ll put $2 toward paying down the national debt. I think it\\'s very important to keep the debt going down and completely eliminate it. And I also think it\\'s very important to go to the next stage of welfare reform. Our country has cut the welfare rolls in half. I fought hard from my days in the Senate and as vice president to cut the welfare rolls and we\\'ve moved millions of people in America into good jobs. But it\\'s now time for the next stage of welfare reform, and include fathers and not only mothers.MODERATOR: We\\'re going to get a lot of those.BUSH: Let me just say that obviously tonight we\\'re going to hear some phony numbers about what I think and what we ought to do. People need to know that over the next ten years it is going to be $25 trillion of revenue that comes into our treasurey and we anticipate spending $21 trillion. And my plan say why don\\'t we pass 1.3 trillion of that back to the people who pay the bills? Surely we can afford 5% of the $25 trillion that are coming into the treasury to the hard working people that pay the bills. There is a difference of opinion. My opponent thinks the government -- the surplus is the government\\'s money. That\\'s not what I think. I think it\\'s the hard-working people of America\\'s money and I want to share some of that money with you so you have more money to build and save and dream for your families. It\\'s a difference of opinion. It\\'s a difference between government making decisions for you and you getting more of your money to make decisions for yourself.MODERATOR: Let me just follow up one quick question. When you hear Vice President Gore question your experience, do you read it the same way, that he\\'s talking about policy differences only?BUSH: Yes. I take him for his word. Look, I fully recognize I\\'m not of Washington. I\\'m from Texas. And he\\'s got a lot of experience, but so do I. And I\\'ve been the chief executive officer of the second biggest state in the union. I have a proud record of working with both Republicans and Democrats, which is what our nation needs. Somebody that can come to Washington and say let\\'s forget all the finger pointing and get positive things done on Medicare, prescription drugs, Social Security, and so I take him for his word.GORE: Jim, if I could just respond. I know that. The governor used the phrase phony numbers, but if you look at the plan and add the numbers up, these numbers are correct. He spends more money for tax cuts for the wealthiest 1% than all of his new spending proposals for health care, prescription drugs, education and national defense all combined. I agree that the surplus is the American people\\'s money, it\\'s your money. That\\'s why I don\\'t think we should give nearly half of it to the wealthiest 1%, because the other 99% have had an awful lot to do with building the surplus in our prosperity.MODERATOR: Three-and-a-half minutes is up. New question.BUSH: I hope itâ€™s about wealthy people.MODERATOR: Governor Bush, you have a question. This is a companion question to the question I asked Vice President Gore. You have questioned whether Vice President Gore has demonstrated the leadership qualities necessary to be President of the United States. What do you mean by that?BUSH: Actually what I\\'ve said, Jim. I\\'ve said that eight years ago they campaigned on prescription drugs for seniors. And four years ago they campaigned on getting prescription drugs for seniors. And now they\\'re campaigning on getting prescription drugs for seniors. It seems like they can\\'t get it done. Now, they may blame other folks, but it\\'s time to get somebody in Washington who is going to work with both Republicans and Democrats to get some positive things done when it comes to our seniors. And so what I\\'ve said is that there\\'s been some missed opportunities. They\\'ve had a chance. They\\'ve had a chance to form consensus. I\\'ve got a plan on Medicare, for example, that\\'s a two-stage plan that says we\\'ll have immediate help for seniors and what I call immediate Helping Hand, a $48 billion program. But I also want to say to seniors, if you\\'re happy with Medicare the way it is, fine, you can stay in the program. But we\\'re going to give you additional choices like they give federal employees in the federal employee health plan. They have a variety of choices to choose, so should seniors. And my point has been, as opposed to politicizing an issue like Medicare, in other words, holding it up as an issue, hoping somebody bites it and try to clobber them over the head with it for political purposes, this year, in the year 2000, it\\'s time to get it done once and for all. That\\'s what I\\'ve been critical about the administration for. Same with Social Security. I think there was a good opportunity to bring Republicans and Democrats together to reform the Social Security system so seniors will never go without. Those on Social Security today will have their promise made, but also to give younger workers the option at their choice of being able to manage some of their own money in the private sector to make sure there\\'s a Social Security system around tomorrow. There are a lot of young workers at our rallies we go to that when they hear I\\'ll trust them at their option to be able to manage, under certain guidelines, some of their own money to get a better rate of return so that they\\'ll have a retirement plan in the future, they begin to nod their heads and they want a different attitude in Washington.MODERATOR: One minute rebuttal.GORE: Well, Jim, under my plan all seniors will get prescription drugs under Medicare. The governor has described Medicare as a government HMO. It\\'s not, and let me explain the difference. Under the Medicare prescription drug proposal I\\'m making, here is how it works, you go to your own doctor. Your doctor chooses your prescription. No HMO or insurance company can take those choices away from you. Then you go to your own pharmacy. You fill the prescription and Medicare pays half the cost. If you\\'re in a very poor family or if you have very high costs, Medicare will pay all the costs, a $25 premium, and much better benefits than you can possibly find in the private sector. Now here is the contrast. 95% of all seniors would get no help whatsoever under my opponent\\'s plan for the first four or five years. Now, one thing I don\\'t understand, Jim, is why is it that the wealthiest 1% get their tax cuts the first year, but 95% of seniors have to wait four to five years before they get a single penny?BUSH: I guess my answer to that is the man is running on Medi-scare. Trying to frighten people in the voting booth. It\\'s just not the way I think and it\\'s not my intentions and not my plan. I want all seniors to have prescription drugs in Medicare. We need to reform Medicare. Thereâ€™s been opportunity to do so but this administration has failed to do it. And so seniors will have not only a Medicare plan where the poor seniors will have prescription drugs paid for, but there will be a variety of options. The current system today has meant a lot for a lot of seniors, and I really appreciate the intentions of the current system as I mentioned. If you\\'re happy with the system you can stay in it. But there are a lot of procedures that haven\\'t kept up in Medicare with the current times. No prescription drug benefits, no drug therapy, no preventative medicines, no vision care. We need to have a modern system to help seniors, and the idea of supporting a federally controlled 132,000-page document bureaucracy as being a compassionate way for seniors, and the only compassionate source of care for seniors is not my vision. I believe we ought to give seniors more options. I believe we ought to make the system work better. I know this. I know it will require a different kind of leader to go to Washington to say to both Republicans and Democrats, let\\'s come together. You\\'ve had your chance, Vice President, you\\'ve been there for eight years and nothing has been done. My point is, is that my plan not only trusts seniors with options, my plan sets aside $3.4 trillion for Medicare over the next ten years. My plan also says it requires a new approach in Washington, D.C. It\\'s going to require somebody who can work across the partisan divide.GORE: If I could respond to that. Under my plan I will put Medicare in an iron clad lockbox and prevent the money from being used for anything other than Medicare. The governor has declined to endorse that idea even though the Republican as well as Democratic leaders in Congress have endorsed it. I would be interested to see if he would say this evening he\\'ll put Medicare in a lockbox. I donâ€™t think he will because under his plan if you work out the numbers Â $100 billion comes out of Medicare just for the wealthiest 1% in the tax cut. Now here is the difference. Some people who say the word reform actually mean cuts. Under the governor\\'s plan, if you kept the same fee for service that you have now under Medicare, your premiums would go up by between 18% and 47%, and that is the study of the Congressional plan that he\\'s modeled his proposal on by the Medicare actuaries. Let me give you one quick example. There is a man here tonight named George McKinney from Milwaukee. He\\'s 70 years old, has high blood pressure, his wife has heart trouble. They have an income of $25,000 a year. They can\\'t pay for their prescription drugs and so they\\'re some of the ones that go to Canada regularly in order to get their prescription drugs. Under my plan, half of their costs would be paid right away. Under Governor Bush\\'s plan, they would get not one penny for four to five years and then they would be forced to go into an HMO or to an insurance company and ask them for coverage, but there would be no limit on the premiums or the deductibles or any of the terms and conditions.BUSH: I cannot let this go by, the old-style Washington politics, of we\\'re going to scare you in the voting booth. Under my plan the man gets immediate help with prescription drugs. It\\'s called Immediate Helping Hand. Instead of squabbling and finger pointing, he gets immediate help. Let me say something.MODERATOR: Your â€“[cross talk]GORE: Can I make another point? They get $25,000 a year income, that makes them ineligible.BUSH: Look, this is a man who has great numbers. He talks about numbers. I\\'m beginning to think not only did he invent the Internet, but he invented the calculator. It\\'s fuzzy math. It\\'s a scaring -- he\\'s trying to scare people in the voting booth. Under my tax plan that he continues to criticize, I set one-third. The federal government should take no more than a third of anybody\\'s check. But I also dropped the bottom rate from 15% to 10%. Because by far the vast majority of the help goes to people at the bottom end of the economic ladder. If you\\'re a family of four in Massachusetts, making $50,000, you get a 50% cut in the federal income taxes you pay. It\\'s from $4000 to about $2000. Now, the difference in our plans is I want that $2,000 to go to you, and the vice president would like to be spending the $2,000 on your behalf.MODERATOR: One quick thing, gentlemen. These are your rules. I\\'m doing my best. We\\'re way over the three and a half minutes. I have no problems with it. Do you want to have a quick response? We\\'re almost to five minutes on this.GORE: It\\'s just clear you can go to the website and look. If you make more than $25,000 a year you don\\'t get a penny of help under the Bush prescription drug proposal for at least four to five years, and then you\\'re pushed into a Medicare -- into an HMO or insurance company plan, and there\\'s no limit on the premiums or the deductibles or any of the conditions. And the insurance companies say it won\\'t work and they won\\'t offer these plans.MODERATOR: Let me ask you both this and we\\'ll move on on the subject. As a practical matter, both of you want to bring prescription drugs to seniors, correct?GORE: Correct.BUSH: Correct.GORE: The difference is I want to bring it to 100% and he wants to bring it to 5%.BUSH: That\\'s totally false for him to stand up here and say that. Let me make sure the seniors hear me loud and clear. They have had their chance to get something done. I\\'m going to work with Democrats and Republicans to reform the system. All seniors will be covered, all poor seniors will have their prescription drugs paid for, and in the meantime, we\\'ll have a plan to help poor seniors and in the meantime it could be one year or two years.GORE: Let me call your attention to the key word there. He said all poor seniors.BUSH: Wait a minute. All seniors are covered under prescription drugs in my plan.GORE: In the first year?BUSH: If we can get it done in the first year, you bet. Yours is phased in in eight years.GORE: It\\'s a two-phase plan. For the first four years -- it takes a year to pass it and for the first four years only the poor are covered. Middle class seniors like George McKinney and his wife are not covered for four to five years.MODERATOR: I have an idea. If you have any more to say about this, you can say it in your closing statements and we\\'ll move on, okay? New question. Vice President Gore. How would you contrast your approach to preventing future oil price and supply problems like we have now to the approach of Governor Bush?GORE: Excellent question. And here is the simple difference. My plan has not only a short-term component, but also a long-term component. And it focuses not only on increasing the supply, which I think we have to do, but also on working on the consumption side. Now, in the short-term we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price from OPEC when they want to raise the price. And in the long-term we have to give new incentives for the development of domestic resources like deep gas in the western Gulf, like stripper wells for oil, but also renewable sources of energy. And domestic sources that are cleaner and better. And I\\'m proposing a plan that will give tax credits and tax incentives for the rapid development of new kinds of cars and trucks and buses and factories and boilers and furnaces that don\\'t have as much pollution, that don\\'t burn as much energy, and that help us get out on the cutting edge of the new technologies that will create millions of new jobs. Because, when we sell these new products here, we\\'ll then be able to sell them overseas. There is a ravenous demand for them overseas. Now, another big difference is Governor Bush is proposing to open up some of our most precious environmental treasures, like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for the big oil companies to go in and start producing oil there. I think that is the wrong choice. It would only give us a few months\\' worth of oil and the oil wouldn\\'t start flowing for many years into the future. I don\\'t think it\\'s a fair price to pay to destroy precious parts of America\\'s environment. We have to bet on the future and move beyond the current technologies to have a whole new generation of more efficient, cleaner, energy technology.BUSH: It\\'s an issue I know a lot about. I was a small oil person for a while in west Texas. This is an administration that\\'s had no plan. And all of a sudden the results of having no plan have caught up with America. First and foremost we have to fully fund LIHEAP which is a way to help low income folks, particularly here in the east to pay for high fuel bills. Secondly, we need an active exploration program in America. The only way to become less dependent on foreign sources of crude oil is to explore at home. You bet I want to open up a small part of Alaska. When that field is online it will produce one million barrels a day. Today we import one million barrels from Saddam Hussein. I would rather that a million come from our own hemisphere, our own country as opposed to Saddam Hussein. I want to build more pipelines to move natural gas throughout this hemisphere. I want to develop the coal resources in America. Have clean coal technologies. Weâ€™ve got abundant supplies of energy here in America and weâ€™d better get after it, we better start exploring it or otherwise we\\'ll be in deep trouble in the future because of our dependency upon foreign sources of crude.MODERATOR: So if somebody is watching tonight and listening to what the two of you just said, is it fair to say, okay, the differences between Governor Bush and Vice President Gore are as follows. You\\'re for doing something on the consumption end and you\\'re for doing something on the production end?GORE: Let me clarify. I\\'m for doing something both on the supply side and production side and on the consumption side. Let me say, that I found one thing in Governor Bush\\'s answer that we certainly agree on, and that\\'s the low income heating assistance program. I commend you for supporting that. I worked to get $400 million just a couple of weeks ago. And to establish a permanent home heating oil reserve here in the northeast. Now, as for the proposals that I\\'ve worked for for renewables and conservation and efficiencies and new technologies. The fact is for the last few years in the Congress, we\\'ve faced a lot of opposition to them. They\\'ve only approved about 10% of the agenda I\\'ve helped to send up there. I think we need to get serious about this energy crisis, both in the Congress and in the White House, and if you entrust me with the presidency, I will tackle this problem and focus on new technologies that will make us less dependent on big oil or foreign oil.MODERATOR: How would you draw the difference?BUSH: Well I would first say he should have been tackling it for the last seven years. Secondly the difference is we need to explore at home. And the vice president doesn\\'t believe in exploration in Alaska. There\\'s a lot of shut-in gas that we need to be moving out of Alaska by pipeline. There\\'s an interesting issue up in the northwest as well. Do we remove dams that produce hydroelectric energy? I\\'m against removing dams in the northwest. I donâ€™t know where the vice president stands but thatâ€™s a renewable energy source of energy. We need to keep that in line. I was in coal country in West Virginia yesterday. There is an abundant supply of coal in America. I know we can do a better job of clean coal technologies. I\\'m going to ask the Congress for $2 billion to make sure we have the cleanest coal technologies in the world. My answer to you is in the short-term we need to get after it here in America. We need to explore our resources and we need to develop our reservoirs of domestic production. We also need to have a hemispheric energy policy where Canada, Mexico and the United States come together. I brought this up recently with Vincent Fox the newly elected president in Mexico, he\\'s a man I know from Mexico. I talked to him about how best to expedite the exploration of natural gas in Mexico and transport it up to the United States so we become less dependent on foreign sources of crude oil. This is a major problem facing America. The administration did not deal with it. It\\'s time for a new administration to deal with the energy problem.GORE: If I may just briefly, Jim, note. I found a couple of other things we agree upon. We may not find that many this evening, so I wanted to emphasize. I strongly support new investments in clean coal technology. I made a proposal three months ago on this. And also domestic exploration yes, but not in the environmental treasures of our country. We don\\'t have to do that. That\\'s the wrong choice. I know the oil companies have been itching to do that, but it is not the right thing for the future.BUSH: No. It\\'s the right thing for the consumers. Less dependency upon foreign sources of crude is good for consumers. And we can do so in an environmentally friendly way.GORE: Well can I have the last word on this?MODERATOR: New question, new subject. Governor Bush. If elected president, would you try to overturn the FDA\\'s approval last week of the abortion pill RU-486?BUSH: I don\\'t think a president can do that. I was disappointed in the ruling because I think abortions ought to be more rare in America, and I\\'m worried that that pill will create more abortions and cause more people to have abortions. This is a very important topic and it\\'s a very sensitive topic, because a lot of good people disagree on the issue. I think what the next president ought to do is to promote a culture of life in America. Life of the elderly and life of those living all across the country. Life of the unborn. As a matter of fact, I think a noble goal for this country is that every child, born or unborn, need to be protected by law and welcomed to life. I know we need to change a lot of minds before we get there in America. What I do believe is that we can find good, common ground on issues of parental consent or parental notification. I know we need to ban partial birth abortions. This is a place where my opponent and I have strong disagreement. I believe banning partial birth abortions would be a positive step to reducing the number of abortions in America. This is an issue that will require a new attitude. We\\'ve been battling over abortion for a long period of time. Surely this nation can come together to promote the value of life. Surely we can fight off these laws that will encourage doctors to -- to allow doctors to take the lives of our seniors. Surely we can work together to create a cultural life so some of these youngsters who feel like they can take a neighbor\\'s life with a gun will understand that that\\'s not the way America is meant to be. Surely we can find common ground to reduce the number of abortions in America. As to the drug itself, I mentioned I was disappointed. I hope the FDA took its time to make sure that American women will be safe who use this drug.MODERATOR: Vice President Gore?GORE: Well, Jim, the FDA took 12 years, and I do support that decision. They determined it was medically safe for the women who use that drug. This is indeed a very important issue. First of all on the issue of partial birth or so-called late-term abortion, I would sign a law banning that procedure, provided that doctors have the ability to save a woman\\'s life or to act if her health is severely at risk. That\\'s not the main issue. The main issue is whether or not the Roe v. Wade decision is going to be overturned. I support a woman\\'s right to choose. My opponent does not. It is important because the next president is going to appoint three and maybe even four justices of the Supreme Court. And Governor Bush has declared to the anti-choice groups that he will appoint justices in the mold of Scalia and Clarence Thomas, who are known for being the most vigorous opponents of a woman\\'s right to choose. Here is the difference. He trusts the government to order a woman to do what it thinks she ought to do. I trust women to make the decisions that affect their lives, their destinies and their bodies. And I think a woman\\'s right to choose ought to be protected and defended.MODERATOR: Governor, we\\'ll go to the Supreme Court question in a moment, but make sure I understand your position on RU-486. If you\\'re elected president, not through appointments to the FDA, you won\\'t support legislation to overturn this?BUSH: I don\\'t think a president can unilaterally overturn it. The FDA has made its decision.MODERATOR: That means you wouldn\\'t, through appointments, to the FDA and ask them to --BUSH: I think once a decision has been made, it\\'s been made unless it\\'s proven to be unsafe to women.GORE: Jim, the question you asked, if I heard you correctly, was would he support legislation to overturn it. And if I heard the statement day before yesterday, you said you would order -- he said he would order his FDA appointee to review the decision. Now that sounds to me a little bit different. I just think that we ought to support the decision.BUSH: I said I would make sure that women would be safe who used the drug.MODERATOR: On the Supreme Court question. Should a voter assume -- you\\'re pro-life.BUSH: I am pro-life.MODERATOR: Should a voter assume that all judicial appointments you make to the supreme court or any other court, federal court, will also be pro-life?BUSH: The voters should assume I have no litmus test on that issue or any other issue. Voters will know I\\'ll put competent judges on the bench. People who will strictly interpret the Constitution and not use the bench to write social policy. That is going to be a big difference between my opponent and me. I believe that the judges ought not to take the place of the legislative branch of government. That they\\'re appointed for life and that they ought to look at the Constitution as sacred. They shouldn\\'t misuse their bench. I don\\'t believe in liberal activist judges. I believe in strict constructionists. Those are the kind of judges I will appoint. I\\'ve named four supreme court justices in the State of Texas and would ask the people to check out their qualifications, their deliberations. They\\'re good, solid men and women who have made good, sound judgments on behalf of the people of Texas.MODERATOR: What kind of appointments should they expect from you?GORE: We both use similar language to reach an exactly opposite outcome. I don\\'t favor a litmus test, but I know that there are ways to assess how a potential justice interprets the Constitution. And in my view, the Constitution ought to be interpreted as a document that grows with our country and our history. And I believe, for example, that there is a right of privacy in the Fourth Amendment. And when the phrase a strict constructionist is used and when the names of Scalia and Thomas are used as the benchmarks for who would be appointed, those are code words, and nobody should mistake this, for saying the governor would appoint people who would overturn Roe v. Wade. It\\'s very clear to me. I would appoint people that have a philosophy that I think would have it quite likely they would uphold Roe v. Wade.MODERATOR: Is the vice president right? Is that a code word for overturning Roe v. Wade?BUSH: It sounds like the vice presidentâ€™s not right very many times tonight. I just told you the criteria on which I\\'ll appoint judges. I have a record of appointing judges in the State of Texas. That\\'s what a governor gets to do. A governor gets to name supreme court judges. He also reads all kinds of things into my tax plan and into my Medicare plan. I want the viewers out there to listen to what I have to say about it.MODERATOR: Reverse the question. What code phrases should we read by what you said about what kind of people you would appoint?GORE: It would be likely that they would uphold Roe v. Wade. I do believe it\\'s wrong to use a litmus test. If you look at the history of a lower court judge\\'s rulings, you can get a pretty good idea of how they\\'ll interpret questions. A lot of questions are first impression, and these questions that have been seen many times come up in a new context and so -- but, you know, this is a very important issue. Because a lot of young women in this country take this right for granted and it could be lost. It is on the ballot in this election, make no mistake about it.BUSH: I\\'ll tell you what kind of judges he\\'ll put on. He\\'ll put liberal activists justices who will use their bench to subvert the legislature, that\\'s what he\\'ll do.GORE: Thatâ€™s not right.MODERATOR: New subject, new question. Vice President Gore, if President Milosevic of Yugoslavia refuses to accept the election results and leave office, what action, if any, should the United States take to get him out of there?GORE: Well, Milosevic has lost the election. His opponent, Kostunica, has won the election. It\\'s overwhelming. Milosevic\\'s government refuses to release the vote count. There\\'s now a general strike going on. They\\'re demonstrating. I think we should support the people of Serbia and Yugoslavia, as they call the Serbia plus Montenegro, and put pressure in every way possible to recognize the lawful outcome of the election. The people of Serbia have acted very bravely in kicking this guy out of office. Now he is trying to not release the votes and then go straight to a so-called runoff election without even announcing the results of the first vote. Now, we\\'ve made it clear, along with our allies, that when Milosevic leaves, then Serbia will be able to have a more normal relationship with the rest of the world. That is a very strong incentive that we\\'ve given them to do the right thing. Bear in mind also, Milosevic has been indicted as a war criminal and he should be held accountable for his actions. Now, we have to take measured steps because the sentiment within Serbia is, for understandable reasons, against the United States because their nationalism -- even if they don\\'t like Milosevic, they still have some feelings lingering from the NATO action there. So we have to be intelligent in the way we go about it. But make no mistake about it, we should do everything we can to see that the will of the Serbian people expressed in this extraordinary election is done. And I hope that he\\'ll be out of office very shortly.MODERATOR: Governor Bush, one minute.BUSH: Well, I\\'m pleased with the results of the election. As the vice president is. It\\'s time for the man to go. It means that the United States must have a strong diplomatic hand with our friends in NATO. That\\'s why it\\'s important to make sure our alliances are as strong as they possibly can be to keep the pressure on Mr. Milosevic. But this will be an interesting moment for the Russians to step up and lead as well. Be a wonderful time for the Russians to step into the Balkans and convince Mr. Milosevic that it\\'s in his best interest and his country\\'s best interest to leave office. The Russians have a lot of sway in that part of the world. We would like to see the Russians use that sway to encourage democracy to take hold. It\\'s an encouraging election. It\\'s time for the man to leave.MODERATOR: What if he doesn\\'t leave? What if all the diplomatic efforts, all the pressure from all over the world and he still doesn\\'t go? Is this the kind of thing, to be specific, that you as president would consider the use of U.S. military force to get him gone?GORE: In this particular situation, no. Bear in mind that we have a lot of sanctions in force against Serbia right now. And the people of Serbia know that they can escape all those sanctions if this guy is turned out of power. Now, I understand what the governor has said about asking the Russians to be involved, and under some circumstances that might be a good idea. But being as they have not yet been willing to recognize Kostunica as the lawful winner of the election, I\\'m not sure it\\'s right for us to invite the president of Russia to mediate this -- this dispute there because we might not like the results that comes out of that. They currently favor going forward with a runoff election. I think that\\'s the wrong thing. I think the governor\\'s instinct is not necessarily bad because we have worked with the Russians in a constructive way in Kosovo, for example, to end the conflict there. But I think we need to be very careful in the present situation before we invite the Russians to play the lead role in mediating.BUSH: Well obviously we wouldn\\'t use the Russians if they didn\\'t agree with our answer, Mr. Vice President.GORE: They donâ€™t.BUSH: Let me say this to you, I wouldn\\'t use force. I wouldn\\'t use force.MODERATOR: You wouldn\\'t use force?BUSH: No.MODERATOR: Why not?BUSH: It\\'s not in our national interest to use force in this case. I would use pressure and diplomacy. There is a difference with what the president did in Kosovo which I supported and this. It\\'s up to the people in this region to take control of their country.MODERATOR: New question. How would you go about as president deciding when it was in the national interest to use U.S. force, generally?BUSH: Well, if it\\'s in our vital national interests, and that means whether our territory is threatened or people could be harmed, whether or not the alliances are -- our defense alliances are threatened, whether or not our friends in the Middle East are threatened. That would be a time to seriously consider the use of force. Secondly, whether or not the mission was clear. Whether or not it was a clear understanding as to what the mission would be. Thirdly, whether or not we were prepared and trained to win. Whether or not our forces were of high morale and high standing and well-equipped. And finally, whether or not there was an exit strategy. I would take the use of force very seriously. I would be guarded in my approach. I don\\'t think we can be all things to all people in the world. I think we\\'ve got to be very careful when we commit our troops. The vice president and I have a disagreement about the use of troops. He believes in nation building. I would be very careful about using our troops as nation builders. I believe the role of the military is to fight and win war and therefore prevent war from happening in the first place. So I would take my responsibility seriously. And it starts with making sure we rebuild our military power. Morale in today\\'s military is too low. We\\'re having trouble meeting recruiting goals. We met the goals this year, but in the previous years we have not met recruiting goals. Some of our troops are not well-equipped. I believe we\\'re overextended in too many places. And therefore I want to rebuild the military power. It starts with a billion dollar pay raise for the men and women who wear the uniform. A billion dollars more than the president recently signed into law. It\\'s to make sure our troops are well-housed and well-equipped. Bonus plans to keep some of our high-skilled folks in the services and a commander in chief who clearly sets the mission. The mission is to fight and win war and therefore prevent war from happening in the first place.MODERATOR: Vice President Gore, one minute.GORE: Let me tell you what Iâ€™ll do. First of all Â I want to make it clear, our military is the strongest, best-trained, best-equipped, best-led fighting force in the world and in the history of the world. Nobody should have any doubt about that, least of all our adversaries or potential adversaries. If you entrust me with the presidency, I will do whatever is necessary in order to make sure our forces stay the strongest in the world. In fact, in my ten-year budget proposal I\\'ve set aside more than twice as much for this purpose as Governor Bush has in his proposal. Now, I think we should be reluctant to get involved in someplace in a foreign country. But if our national security is at stake, if we have allies, if we\\'ve tried every other course, if we\\'re sure military action will succeed, and if the costs are proportionate to the benefits, we should get involved. Now, just because we don\\'t want to get involved everywhere doesn\\'t mean we should back off anywhere it comes up. I disagree with the proposal that maybe only when oil supplies are at stake that our national security is at risk. I think that there are situations like in Bosnia or Kosovo where there\\'s a genocide, where our national security is at stake there.BUSH: I agree our military is the strongest in the world today, that\\'s not the question. The question is will it be the strongest in the years to come? The warning signs are real. Everywhere I go on the campaign trail I see moms and dads whose son or daughter may wear the uniform and they tell me about how discouraged their son or daughter may be. A recent poll was taken among 1,000 enlisted personnel, as well as officers, over half of whom will leave the service when their time of enlistment is up. The captains are leaving the service. There is a problem. And it\\'s going to require a new commander in chief to rebuild the military power. The other day I was honored to be flanked by Colin Powell and General Norman Schwartzkopf recently stood by me side and agreed with me. They said even if we are the strongest if we donâ€™t do something if we don\\'t have a clear vision of the military, if we don\\'t stop extending our troops all around the world and nation building missions, then we\\'re going to have a serious problem coming down the road, and I\\'m going to prevent that. I\\'m going to rebuild our military power. It\\'s one of the major priorities of my administration.MODERATOR: Vice President Gore, how should the voters go about deciding which one of you is better suited to make the kinds of decisions, whether it\\'s Milosevic or whatever, in the military and foreign policy area?GORE: Well, they should look at our proposals and look at us as people and make up their own minds. When I was a young man, I volunteered for the Army. I served my country in Vietnam. My father was a senator who strongly opposed the Vietnam War. I went to college in this great city, and most of my peers felt against the war as I did. But I went anyway because I knew if I didn\\'t, somebody else in the small town of Carthage, Tennessee, would have to go in my place. I served for eight years in the House of Representatives and I served on the Intelligence Committee, specialized in looking at arms control. I served for eight years in the United States Senate and served on the Armed Services Committee. For the last eight years I\\'ve served on the National Security Council, and when the conflict came up in Bosnia, I saw a genocide in the heart of Europe with the most violent war on the continent of Europe since World War II. Look, that\\'s where World War I started in the Balkans. My uncle was a victim of poisonous gas there. Millions of Americans saw the results of that conflict. We have to be willing to make good, sound judgments. Incidentally, I know the value of making sure our troops have the latest technology. The governor has proposed skipping the next generation of weapons. I think that\\'s a big mistake, because I think we have to stay at the cutting edge.MODERATOR: Governor, how would you advise the voters to make the decision on this issue?BUSH: I think you\\'ve got to look at how one has handled responsibility in office. Whether or not it\\'s -- the same in domestic policy as well. Whether or not you have the capacity to convince people to follow? Whether or not one makes decisions based on sound principles or whether or not you rely upon polls and focus groups on how to decide what the course of action is. We have too much polling and focus groups going on in Washington today. We need decisions made on sound principles. I\\'ve been the governor of a big state. I think one of the hallmarks of my relationship in Austin, Texas, is that I\\'ve had the capacity to work with both Republicans and Democrats. I think that\\'s an important part of leadership. I think what it means to build consensus. I\\'ve shown I know how to do so. Tonight in the audience there\\'s one elected state senator who is a Democrat, a former state-wide officer who is a Democrat, a lot of Democrats who are here in the debate to -- because they want to show their support that shows I know how to lead. And so the fundamental answer to your question, who can lead and who\\'s shown the ability to get things done?GORE: If I could say one thing.MODERATOR: We are way over three-and-a-half minutes. Go ahead.GORE: One of the key points in foreign policy and national security policy is the need to re-establish the old-fashioned principle that politics ought to stop at the water\\'s edge. When I was in the United States Congress, I worked with former President Reagan to modernize our strategic weaponry and to pursue arms control in a responsible way. When I was in the United States Senate I worked with former President Bush, your father. I was one of only a few Democrats in the Senate to support the Persian Gulf War. I think bipartisanship is a national asset. We have to find ways to reestablish it in foreign policy and national security policy.MODERATOR: Do you have a problem with that?BUSH: Yeah. Why haven\\'t they done it in seven years?MODERATOR: New subject. New question. Should the voters of this election, Vice President Gore, see this in the domestic area as a major choice between competing political philosophies?GORE: Oh, absolutely. This is a very important moment in the history of our country. Look, we\\'ve got the biggest surpluses in all of American history. The key question that has to be answered in this election is will we use that prosperity wisely in a way that benefits all of our people and doesn\\'t go just to the few. Almost half of all the tax cut benefits, as I said under Governor Bush\\'s plan, go to the wealthiest 1%. I think we have to make the right and responsible choices. I think we have to invest in education, protecting the environment, health care, a prescription drug benefit that goes to all seniors, not just to the poor, under Medicare, not relying on HMOs and insurance companies. I think that we have to help parents and strengthen families by dealing with the kind of inappropriate entertainment material that families are just heart sick that their children are exposed to. I think we\\'ve got to have welfare reform taken to the next stage. I think that we have got to balance the budget every single year, pay down the national debt and, in fact, under my proposal the national debt will be completely eliminated by the year 2012. I think we need to put Medicare and Social Security in a lockbox. The governor will not put Medicare in a lockbox. I don\\'t think it should be used as a piggy bank for other programs. I think it needs to be moved out of the budget and protected. I\\'ll veto anything that takes money out of Social Security or Medicare for anything other than Social Security or Medicare. Now, the priorities are just very different. I\\'ll give you a couple of examples. For every new dollar that I propose for spending on health care, Governor Bush spends $3 for a tax cut for the wealthiest 1%. Now, for every dollar that I propose to spend on education, he spends $5 on a tax cut for the wealthiest 1%. Those are very clear differences.MODERATOR: Governor, one minute.BUSH: The man is practicing fuzzy math again. There\\'s differences. Under Vice President Gore\\'s plan, he is going to grow the federal government in the largest increase since Lyndon Baines Johnson in 1965. We\\'re talking about a massive government, folks. We\\'re talking about adding to or increasing 200 programs, 20,000 new bureaucrats. Imagine how many IRS agents it is going to take to be able to figure out his targeted tax cut for the middle class that excludes 50 million Americans. There is a huge difference in this campaign. He says he\\'s going to give you tax cuts. 50 million of you won\\'t receive it. He said in his speech he wants to make sure the right people get tax relief. That\\'s not the role of a president to decide right and wrong. Everybody who pays taxes ought to get tax relief. After my plan is in place, the wealthiest Americans will pay a higher percentage of taxes then they do today, the poorest of Americans, six million families, won\\'t pay any tax at all. It\\'s a huge difference. A difference between big exploding federal government that wants to think on your behalf and a plan that meets priorities and liberates working people to be able to make decisions on your own.GORE: Let me just say, Jim, you haven\\'t heard the governor deny these numbers. He\\'s called them phony and fuzzy. The fact remains almost 30% of his proposed tax cut goes to -- only to Americans that make more than $1 million per year. More money goes to the -- can I have a rebuttal here?MODERATOR: I want to see if he buys that.BUSH: Let me tell you what the facts are. The facts are after my plan, the wealthiest of Americans pay more taxes of the percentage of the whole than they do today. Secondly, if you\\'re a family of four making $50,000 in Massachusetts, you get a 50% tax cut. Let me give you one example. The Strunk family in Allentown, Pennsylvania, I campaigned with them the other day. They make $51,000 combined income, they pay about $3500 in taxes. Under my plan, they get $1800 of tax relief. Under Vice President Gore\\'s plan, they get $145 of tax relief. Now you tell me who stands on the side of the fence. You ask the Strunks whose plan makes more sense. There is a difference of opinion. He would rather spend the family\\'s $1800 and I would rather the Strunks spend their own money.MODERATOR: Do you see it that way Mr. Vice President?GORE: No, I don\\'t, and I\\'m not going to go to calling names on his facts. I\\'m just gonna tell you what the real facts are. The analysis that he\\'s talking about leaves out more than half of the tax cuts that I have proposed. And if you just add the numbers up, he still hasn\\'t denied it, he spends more money on a tax cut for the wealthiest 1% than all his new proposals for prescription drugs, healthcare, education, and national defense combined. Now those are the wrong priorities. $665 billion over ten years for the wealthiest 1%. As I said, almost 30% of it goes to Americans that make more than $1 million per year. Every middle class family is eligible for a tax cut under my proposal. Let me give you some specific examples. I believe college tuition up to $10,000 per year ought to be tax deductible so middle-class families can choose to send their children to college. I believe all senior citizens should be able to choose their own doctors and get prescription drugs from their own pharmacists with Medicare paying half the bill. I believe parents ought to be able to make more choices need more public and charter school choice to send their kids always to a safe school. We need to make education the number one priority in our country and treat teachers like the professionals that they are. And that\\'s why I have made it a number one priority in my budget, not a tax cut for the wealthy.BUSH: Let me talk about tax cuts one more time. This is a man whose plan excludes 50 million Americans.GORE: Not so.BUSH: Take for example the marriage penalty. If you itemize your tax return, you get no marriage penalty relief. He picks and chooses. He decides who the right people are. It\\'s a fundamental difference of opinion. I want my fellow Americans to hear one more time. We\\'ll spend $25 trillion -- we\\'ll collect $25 trillion in revenue in the next 10 years and spend $21 trillion. Surely we can send 5% back to you that pay the bills. Thereâ€™s a problem wait. I want to say something, Jim. This man has been disparaging my plan with all this Washington fuzzy math. I want you to hear a problem weâ€™ve got here in the USA. If you\\'re a single mother making $22,000 a year and you have two children, under this tax code, for every additional dollar you make, you pay a higher marginal rate on that dollar than someone making more than $200,000 a year, and that is not right. My plan drops the rate from 15% to 10% and increases the child credit from $500 to $1,000 to make the code more fair for everybody, not just a few, not just a handful. Everybody who pays taxes ought to get some relief.MODERATOR: Having cleared that up, we\\'re going to a new question. Education. Governor Bush. Both of you have promised dramatically to change -- to change dramatically public education in this country. Of the public money spent on education, only 6% of that is federal money. You want to change 100% of the public education with 6% of the money, is that possible?BUSH: We can make a huge difference by saying if you receive federal money we expect you to show results. Let me give you a story about public education, if I might. It\\'s about Kipp Academy in Houston, Texas. A charter school run by some people from Teach For America. Young folks saying I\\'m going to do something good for my country. I want to teach. A guy named Michael runs the school. It is a school full of so-called at-risk children. It\\'s how we unfortunately label certain children. Basically it means they can\\'t learn. It\\'s a school of strong discipline and high standards. It\\'s one of the best schools in Houston. Here are the key ingredients. High expectations, strong accountabily. What Michael says, don\\'t put all these rules on us, just let us teach and hold us accountable for every grade. That\\'s what we do. And as a result, these mainly Hispanic youngsters are some of the best learners in Houston, Texas. That\\'s my vision for public education all around America. Many of you viewers don\\'t know, but Laura and I sent our girls to public school. They went to Austin High School. And many of the public schools are meeting the call. But, unfortunately, a lot of schools are trapping children in schools that just won\\'t teach and won\\'t change. Here is the role of the federal government. One is to change Head Start to a reading program. Two is to say if you want to access reading money, you can do so. The goal is for every single child to learn to Read. there must by K-2 diagnostic teaching tools, teacher training money, available. Three, we have to consolidate the federal programs to free districts to free the schools and encourage innovators like Michael. Let them reach out beyond the confines of the current structure to recruit teach-for-the-children type teachers. Four, we\\'re going to say if you receive federal money, measure third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth grade. Show us if they are learning to read, write, add and subtract and if so there will be bonus plans. But if not, instead of continuing to subsidize failure, the money will go to -- the federal money will go to the parents for public school or charter school or tutorial or Catholic school. What I care about is children. And so does Michael Feinberg. And you know what? It can happen in America with the right kind of leadership.GORE: We agree on a couple of things on education. I strongly support new accountability, so does Governor Bush. I strongly support local control, so does Governor Bush. I\\'m in favor of testing as a way of measuring performance. Every school and every school district, have every state test the children. I\\'ve also proposed a voluntary national test in the fourth grade and eighth grade, and a form of testing the governor has not endorsed. I think that all new teachers ought to be tested in the subjects that they teach. We\\'ve got to recruit 100,000 new teachers. And I have budgeted for that. We\\'ve got to reduce the class size so that the student who walks in has more one-on-one time with the teacher. We ought to have universal pre-school and we ought to make college tuition tax deductible, up to $10,000 a year. I would like to tell you a quick story. I got a letter today as I left Sarasota, Florida. I\\'m here with a group of 13 people from around the country who helped me prepare. We had a great time. Two days ago we ate lunch at a restaurant. The guy that served us lunch gave me a letter today. His name is Randy Ellis. He has a 15-year-old daughter named Caley, who is in Sarasota High School. Her science class was supposed to be for 24 students. She\\'s the 36th student in that classroom. They sent me a picture of her in the classroom. They can\\'t squeeze another desk in for her, so she has to stand during class. I want the federal government, consistent with local control and new accountability, to make improvement of our schools the number one priority so Caley will have a desk and can sit down in a classroom where she can learn.MODERATOR: All right. So having heard the two of you, the voters have just heard the two of you, what is the difference? What is the choice between the two of you on education?BUSH: The first is, the difference is there is no new accountability measures in Vice President Gore\\'s plan. He says he\\'s for voluntary testing. You can\\'t have voluntary testing. You must have mandatory testing. You must say that if you receive money you must show us whether or not children are learning to read and write and add and subtract. That\\'s the difference. You may claim you\\'ve got mandatory testing but you don\\'t, Mr. Vice President. That\\'s a huge difference. Testing is the cornerstone of reform. You know how I know? Because it\\'s the cornerstone of reform in the State of Texas. Republicans and Democrats came together and said what can we do to make our public education the best in the country? We\\'ve done a long way working together to do so. The cornerstone is to have strong accountability in return for money and in return for flexibility. We\\'re going to ask you to show us whether or not -- we ask you to post the results on the Internet. We encourage parents to take a look at the comparative results of schools. We have a strong charter school movement that I signed the legislation to get started in the State of Texas. I believe if we find poor children trapped in schools that won\\'t teach, we need to free the parents. We need to expand education savings accounts. Something that the vice presidentâ€™s running mate supports. There\\'s big differences. He won\\'t support freeing local districts from the strings of federal money.GORE: First of all, I do have mandatory testing. I think the governor may not have heard what I said clearly. The voluntary national testing is in addition to the mandatory testing that we require of states. All schools, all school districts, students themselves, and required teacher testing, which goes a step farther than Governor Bush has been willing to go. Here are a couple of differences, though, Jim. Governor Bush is in favor of vouchers which take taxpayer money away from public schools and give them to private schools that are not accountable for how the money is used and don\\'t have to take all applicants. Now, private schools play a great role in our society. All of our children have gone to both public schools and private schools. But I don\\'t think private schools should have a right to take taxpayer money away from public schools at a time when Caley Ellis is standing in that classroom. Let me give you another example. I went to a school in Dade County, Florida where the facilities are so overcrowded the children have to eat lunch in shifts with the first shift for lunch starting at 9:30 in the morning. Look, this is a funding crisis all around the country. There are fewer parents of school-age children as a percentage of the voting population and there is the largest generation of students ever. We\\'re in an information age when learning is more important than ever. 90% of our kids go to public schools. We have to make it the number one priority. Modernize our schools, reduce class size, recruit new teachers, give every child a chance to learn with one-on-one time in a quality -- high-quality, safe school. If it\\'s a failing school, shut it down and reopen it under a new principal with a turnaround team of specialists the way Governor Jim Hunt does in North Carolina. Here is another difference. The governor, if it\\'s a failing school, would leave the children in that failing school for three years and then give a little bit of money to the parents, a down payment on a down payment for private school tuition, and pretend that that would be enough for them to go out and go to a private school. It\\'s an illusion.MODERATOR: Wait a minute, Governor.BUSH: Okay. First of all, most of good governance is at the state level. See, here is the mentality. I\\'m going to make the state do this and make the state do that. All I\\'m saying is if you spend money, show us results and test every year, which you do not do, Mr. Vice President. You don\\'t test every year. You can say you do to the cameras but you don\\'t, unless you\\'ve changed your plan here on the stage.GORE: I didn\\'t say that.BUSH: You need to test every year. That\\'s how you determine if children are progressing to excellence. Secondly, one of the things that we have to be careful about in politics is throwing money at a system that has not yet been reformed. More money is needed and I spend more money, but step one is to make sure we reform the system to have the system in place that leaves no child behind. Stop this business about asking gosh, how old are you? If you\\'re 10 we\\'ll put you here, 12 you put here. Start asking the question, what do you know? If you don\\'t know what you\\'re supposed to know, we\\'ll make sure you do early before it\\'s too late.MODERATOR: New question. We\\'ve been talking about a lot of specific issues. It\\'s often said that in the final analysis about 90% of being the President of the United States is dealing with the unexpected, not with issues that came up in the campaign. Vice President Gore, can you point to a decision, an action you have taken, that illustrates your ability to handle the unexpected, the crisis under fire?GORE: When the action in Kosovo was dragging on and we were searching for a solution to the problem, our country had defeated the adversary on the battlefield without a single American life being lost in combat. But the dictator Milosevic was hanging on. I invited the former prime minister of Russia to my house and took a risk in asking him to get personally involved, along with the head of Finland, to go to Belgrade and to take a set of proposals from the United States that would constitute basically a surrender by Serbia. But it was a calculated risk that paid off. Now, I could probably give you some other examples of decisions over the last 24 years. I have been in public service for 24 years, Jim. And throughout all that time the people I have fought for have been the middle-class families, and I have been willing to stand up to powerful interests like the big insurance companies, the drug companies, the HMOs, the oil companies. They have good people and they play constructive roles sometimes, but sometimes they get too much power. I cast my lot with the people even when it means that you have to stand up to some powerful interests who are trying to turn the -- the policies and the laws to their advantage. You can see it in this campaign. The big drug companies support Governor Bush\\'s prescription drug proposal. They oppose mine because they don\\'t want to get Medicare involved because they\\'re afraid that Medicare will negotiate lower prices for seniors who currently pay the highest prices of all.MODERATOR: Governor Bush?BUSH: I\\'ve been standing up to big Hollywood, big trial lawyers. Was â€“ what was the question? It was about emergencies, wasn\\'t it?MODERATOR: It was about -- okay.BUSH: You know, as governor, one of the things you have to deal with is catastrophe. I can remember the fires that swept Parker County, Texas. I remember the floods that swept our state. I remember going down to Del Rio, Texas. I have to pay the administration a compliment. James Lee Witt of FEMA has done a really good job of working with governors during times of crisis. But that\\'s the time when you\\'re tested not only -- it\\'s the time to test your mettle, a time to test your heart when you see people whose lives have been turned upside down. It broke my heart to go to the flood scene in Del Rio where a fellow and his family got completely uprooted. The only thing I knew to do was to get aid as quickly as possible with state and federal help, and to put my arms around the man and his family and cry with them. That\\'s what governors do. They are often on the front line of catastrophic situations.MODERATOR: New question. There can be all kinds of crises, Governor. A questions for you. There could be a crisis, for instance, in the financial area, the stock market could take a tumble, there could be a failure of a major financial institution. What is your general attitude toward government intervention in such events?BUSH: Well, it depends, obviously. But what I would do first and foremost, is I would get in touch with the Federal Reserve Chairman, Alan Greenspan, to find out all the facts and all the circumstances. I would have my Secretary of the Treasury be in touch with the financial centers not only here, but at home. I would make sure that key members of Congress were called in to discuss the gravity of the situation. And I would come up with a game plan to deal with it. That\\'s what governors end up doing. We end up being problem solvers. We come up with practical, common sense solutions for problems that we\\'re confronted with. In this case, in the case of a financial crisis, I would gather all the facts before I made the decision as to what the government ought or ought not to do.MODERATOR: Vice President Gore?GORE: First I want to compliment the governor on his response to those fires and floods in Texas. I accompanied James Lee Witt down to Texas when those fires broke out. And FEMA has been a major flagship project of our reinventing government efforts. And I agree, it works extremely well now. On the international financial crises that come up, my friend, Bob Rubin, the former Secretary of Treasury is here, he\\'s a close advisor to me and great friend in all respects. I have had a chance to work with him and Alan Greenspan and others on the crisis following the collapse of the Mexican peso. When the Asian financial crisis raised the risk of world-wide recession that could affect our economy, And now, of course, the euro\\'s value has been dropping, but seems to be under control. But it started for me in the last eight years when I had the honor of casting the tie-breaking vote to end the old economic plan here at home and put into place a new economic plan that has helped us to make some progress, 22 million new jobs, the greatest prosperity ever. But it\\'s not good enough. My attitude is you ain\\'t seen nothing yet. We need to do more and better.MODERATOR: So, Governor, would you agree there is no basic difference here on intervening -- on federal government intervening in what might be seen by others to be a private financial crisis?BUSH: No, there\\'s no difference on that. There is a difference, though, as to what the economy has meant. I think the economy has meant more for the Gore and Clinton folks than the Gore and Clinton folks have meant for the economy. I think most of the economic growth that has taken place is a result of ingenuity and hard work and entrepreneurship and that\\'s the role of goverment to encourage that. In terms of in response to the question, no.GORE: Can I comment on that?MODERATOR: You may.GORE: You know, I think the American people deserve credit for the great economy that we have. It\\'s their ingenuity, I agree with that. But you know, they were working pretty hard eight years ago. And now they had ingenuity eight years ago. The difference is we\\'ve got a new policy. And instead of concentrating on tax cuts mostly for the wealthy, we want -- I want tax cuts for the middle-class families and I want to continue the prosperity and make sure that it enriches not just a few but all of our families. We have gone from the biggest deficits to the biggest surpluses. We have gone from a triple-dip recession during the previous 12 years to a tripling of the stock market. Instead of a high unemployment, we have the lowest African-American and Latin American unemployment rates in history and 22 million new jobs. It\\'s not good enough. Too many people have been left behind. We have got to do much more. The key is job training, education, investments in health care and education, environment, retirement security. And incidentally, we have got to preserve Social Security. I\\'m totally opposed to diverting one out of every six dollars out of the Social Security trust fund, as the Governor has proposed, into the stock market. I want new incentives for savings and investment for the young couples who are working hard so they can save and invest on their own on top of Social Security, not at the expense of Social Security, as the governor proposes.BUSH: Two points. One, a lot of folks are still waiting for that 1992 middle-class tax cut. I remember the vice president saying, \"Just give us a chance to get up there, we\\'re going to make sure you get tax cuts.\" It didn\\'t happen. Now he\\'s having to say that again. They\\'ve had their chance to deliver a tax cut to you. Secondly, the surest way to bust this economy is to increase the role and size of the federal budget. The Senate Budget Committee did a study of the vice president\\'s expenditures. It\\'s been projected that they could conceivably bust the budget by $900 billion. That means he\\'ll either have to raise your taxes by $900 billion or go into the Social Security surplus for $900 billion. This is a plan that is going to increase the bureaucracy by 20,000 people. His targeted tax cut is so detailed, so much fine print that it is going to require numerous IRS agents. We need somebody to simplify the code, to be fair, to continue prosperity by sharing some of the surplus with the people who pay the bills, particularly those at the bottom end of the economic ladder.GORE: If I could respond, Jim. What he\\'s quoting is not the Senate Budget Commiitte, it is a partisan press release by the Republicans on the Senate Budget Committee that\\'s not worth the government -- the taxpayer-paid paper that it\\'s printed on. Now, as for 20,000 new bureaucrats, as you call them, you know, the size of the federal government will go down in a Gore administration. In the reinventing government program you just look at the numbers. It is 300,000 people smaller today than it was eight years ago. Now, the fact is you\\'re going to have a hard time convincing folks that we were a whole lot better off eight years ago than we are today. But that\\'s not the question. The question is, will we be better off four years from now than we are today? And as for the surest way to threaten our prosperity, having a $1.9 trillion tax cut, almost half of which goes to the wealthy, and a $1 trillion Social Security privatization proposal is the surest way to put our budget into deficit â€“ raise interest rates and put our prosperity at risk.BUSH: I can\\'t let the man continue with fuzzy math. It is 1.3 trillion Mr. Vice President. It will go to everybody who pays taxes. I\\'m not going to be the kind of president that says you get tax relief and you don\\'t. I\\'m not going to be a picker and chooser. What is fair is everybody who pays taxes ought to get relief.MODERATOR: I thought we cleared this up a while ago. New question on Social Security. Both of you have Social Security reform plans, so we could spend the rest of the evening and two or three other evenings talking about them in detail. We won\\'t do that. But --GORE: Suits me.MODERATOR: Many experts, including Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan, Vice President Gore, say that it will be impossible for either of you, essentially, to keep the system viable on its own during the coming baby boomer retirement onslaught without either reducing benefits or increasing taxes. You disagree?GORE: I do disagree. Because if we can keep our prosperity going, if we can continue balancing the budget and paying down the debt, then the strong economy keeps generating surpluses. Here is my plan. I will keep Social Security in a lockbox and that pays down the national debt. And the interest savings I would put right back into Social Security. That extends the life of Social Security for 55 years. Now, I think that it\\'s very important to understand that cutting benefits under Social Security means that people like Winifred Skinner from Des Moines, Iowa, who is here, would really have a much harder time. Because there are millions of seniors who are living almost hand to mouth. And you talk about cutting benefits. I don\\'t go along with it. I am opposed to it. I\\'m also opposed to a plan that diverts 1 out of every $6 away from the Social Security Trust Fund. Social Security is a trust fund that pays the checks this year with the money that is paid into Social Security this year. The governor wants to divert 1 out of every $6 off into the stock market, which means that he would drain a trillion dollars out of the Social Security Trust Fund in this generation over the next ten years, and Social Security under that approach would go bankrupt within this generation. His leading advisor on this plan actually said that would be okay, because then the Social Security Trust Fund could start borrowing. It would borrow up to $3 trillion. Now, Social Security has never done that. And I don\\'t think it should do that. I think it should stay in a lockbox, and I\\'ll tell you this. I will veto anything that takes money out of Social Security for privatization or anything else other than Social Security.BUSH: I thought it was interesting that on the two minutes he spent about a million-and-a-half on my plan, which means he doesn\\'t want you to know what he\\'s doing is loading up IOUs for future generations. He puts no real assets into the Social Security system. The revenues exceed the expenses in Social Security until the year 2015 which means all retirees are going to get the promises made. For those of you who he wants to scare into the voting booth to vote for him, hear me loud and clear. A promise made will be a promise kept. You bet we want to allow younger workers to take some of their own money. That\\'s the difference of opinion. The vice president thinks it\\'s the government\\'s money. The payroll taxes are your money. You ought to put it in prudent, safe investments so that $1 trillion over the next ten years grows to be $3 trillion. The money stays within the Social Security system. It\\'s a part of the Social Security system. He claims it will be out of Social Security. It\\'s your money, it\\'s a part of your retirement benefit. It\\'s a fundamental difference between what we believe. I want you to have your own asset that you can call your own. That you can pass on from one generation to the next. I want to get a better rate of return for your own money than the paltry 2% that the current Social Security Trust gets today. Mr. Greenspan I thought missed an opportunity to say there\\'s a third way, and that is to get a better rate of return on the Social Security monies coming into the trust. There is $2.3 trillion of surplus that we can use to make sure that younger workers have a Social Security plan in the future. If we\\'re smart and if we trust workers and if we understand the power of the compounding rate of interest.GORE: Here is the difference. I give a new incentive for younger workers to save their own money and invest their own money, but not at the expense of Social Security, on top of Social Security. My plan is Social Security plus. The governor\\'s plan is Social Security minus. Your future benefits would be cut by the amount that\\'s diverted into the stock market. If you make bad investments, that\\'s too bad. But even before then the problem hits because the money contributed to Social Security this year is an entitlement. That\\'s how it works. And the money is used to pay the benefits for seniors this year. If you cut the amount going in 1 out of every $6, then you have to cut the value of each check by 1 out of every $6 unless you come up with the money from somewhere else. I would like to know from the governor -- I know we\\'re not supposed to ask each other questions -- but I\\'d be interested in knowing, does that trillion dollars come from the trust fund, or does it come from the rest of the budget?BUSH: No. There\\'s enough money to pay seniors today in the current affairs of Social Security. The trillion comes from the surplus. Surplus is money -- more money than needed. Let me tell you what your plan is. It\\'s not Social Security plus, it\\'s Social Security plus huge debt. That is what it is. You leave future generations with tremendous IOUs. It\\'s time to have a leader that doesn\\'t put off tomorrow what we should do today. It\\'s time to have somebody to step up and say look, let\\'s let younger workers take some of their own money and under certain guidelines invest it in the private markets. The safest of federal investments yields 4%. That\\'s twice the amount of rate of return than the current Social Security Trust. It\\'s a fundamental difference of opinion here, folks. Younger worker after younger worker hears my call that says I trust you. And you know what, the issue is changing. Seniors now understand that the promise made will be a promise kept, but younger workers now understand we better have a government that trusts them and that\\'s exactly what I\\'m going to do.GORE: Could I respond to that, Jim? This is a big issue. Could we do another round on it?MODERATOR: We\\'re almost out of time.GORE: Just briefly. When FDR established Social Security, they didn\\'t call them IOUs, they called it the full faith and credit of the United States. If you don\\'t have trust in that, I do. If you take it out of the surplus in the trust fund, that means the trust fund goes bankrupt in this generation within 20 years.BUSH: This is a government that thinks a 2% rate of return on your money is satisfactory. It\\'s not. This is a government that says younger workers can\\'t possibly have their own assets. We need to think differently about the issue. We need to make sure our seniors get the promise made. If we don\\'t trust younger workers to manage some of their own money with the Social Security surplus, to grow from $1 trillion to $3 trillion, it will be impossible to bridge the gap without it. What Mr. Gore\\'s plan will do causing huge payroll taxes or major benefit reductions.MODERATOR: New question. Are there issues of character that distinguish you from Vice President Gore?BUSH: The man loves his wife and I appreciate that a lot. And I love mine. The man loves his family a lot, and I appreciate that, because I love my family. I think the thing that discouraged me about the vice president was uttering those famous words, \"No controlling legal authority.\" I felt like there needed to be a better sense of responsibility of what was going on in the White House. I believe that -- I believe they\\'ve moved that sign, \"The buck stops here\" from the Oval Office desk to \"The buck stops here\" on the Lincoln bedroom. It\\'s not good for the country and it\\'s not right. We need to have a new look about how we conduct ourselves in office. There\\'s a huge trust. I see it all the time when people come up to me and say, I don\\'t want you to let me down again. And we can do better than the past administration has done. It\\'s time for a fresh start. It\\'s time for a new look. It\\'s time for a fresh start after a season of cynicism. And so I don\\'t know the man well, but I\\'ve been disappointed about how he and his administration have conducted the fundraising affairs. You know, going to a Buddhist temple and then claiming it wasn\\'t a fundraiser isn\\'t my view of responsibility.MODERATOR: Vice President Gore?GORE: I think we ought to attack our country\\'s problems, not attack each other. I want to spend my time making this country even better than it is, not trying to make you out to be a bad person. You may want to focus on scandal. I want to focus on results. As I said a couple of months ago, I stand here as my own man and I want you to see me for who I really am. Tipper and I have been married for 30 years. We became grandparents a year-and-a-half ago. We\\'ve got four children. I have devoted 24 years of my life to public service and I\\'ve said this before and I\\'ll say it again, if you entrust me with the presidency, I may not be the most exciting politician, but I will work hard for you every day. I will fight for middle-class families and working men and women and I will never let you down.MODERATOR: So, Governor, what are you saying when you mention the fundraising scandals or the fundraising charges that involve Vice President Gore? What are you saying that the voters should take from that that\\'s relevant to this election?BUSH: They ought to factor in it when they go to the voting booth.MODERATOR: In what way?BUSH: I think people need to be held responsible for the actions they take in life. I think that -- well, I think that\\'s part of the need for a cultural change. We need to say we each need to be responsible for what we do. People in the highest office of the land must be responsible for decisions they make in life. And that\\'s the way I\\'ve conducted myself as Governor of Texas and that\\'s the way I\\'ll conduct myself as President of the United States, should I be fortunate enough to earn your vote.MODERATOR: Are you saying all this is irrelevant, Vice President Gore?GORE: No. I think the American people should take into account who we are as individuals, what our experience is, what our positions are on the issues and proposals are. I\\'m asking you to see me for who I really am. I\\'m offering you my own vision, my own experience, my own proposals. And incidentally, one of them is this. This current campaign financing system has not reflected credit on anybody in either party. And that\\'s one of the reasons I\\'ve said before, and I\\'ll pledge here tonight, if I\\'m president, the very first bill that Joe Lieberman and I will send to the United States Congress is the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform bill. And the reason it\\'s that important is that all of the other issues, whether prescription drugs for all seniors that are opposed by the drug companies or the patient\\'s bill of rights to take the decisions away from the HMOs and give them to the doctors and nurses, opposed by the HMOs and insurance companies, all these other proposals are going to be a lot easier to get passed for the American people if we limit the influence of special interest money and give democracy back to the American people. And I wish Governor Bush would join me this evening in endorsing the McCain-Feingold Campaign Finance Reform Bill.BUSH: You know, this man has no credibility on the issue. As a matter of fact, I read in the \"New York Times\" where he said he co-sponsored the McCain-Feingold Campaign Fundraising Bill. But he wasn\\'t in the Senate with Senator Feingold. And so, look, I\\'m going to -- what you need to know about me is I will uphold the law, I\\'m going to have an attorney general that enforces the law. The time for campaign funding reform is after the election. This man has outspent me and the special interests are outspending me. And I am not going to lay down my arms in the middle of the campaign for somebody who has got no credibility on the issue.MODERATOR: Senator McCain -- hold on one second. Senator McCain said in August, \"It doesn\\'t matter which one of you is President of the United States in January, there is going to be blood on the floor of the United States Senate,\" and he\\'ll tie up the Senate until campaign finance reform is passed that includes a ban on soft money. First of all, would you support that effort by him, or would you sign a bill that is finally passed that included --BUSH: I would support an effort to ban corporate soft money and labor union soft money so long as there was dues check-off. I\\'ve campaigned on this since the primaries. I believe there needs to be instant disclosure on the Internet as to who has given to who. I think we need to fully enforce the law. I think we need to have an attorney general that says if a law is broken, we\\'ll enforce it. Be strict and firm about it.GORE: Look, Governor Bush, you have attacked my character and credibility and I am not going to respond in kind. I think we ought to focus on the problems and not attack each other. One of the serious problems, hear me well, is that our system of government is being undermined by too much influence coming from special interest money. We have to get a handle on it. And like John McCain, I have learned from experience, and it\\'s not a new position for me. 24 years ago I supported full public financing of all federal elections. And anybody who thinks I\\'m just saying it, it will be the first bill I send to the Congress. I want you to know I care passionately about this and I will fight until it becomes law.BUSH: I want people to hear what he just said. He is for full public financing of Congressional elections. I\\'m absolutely, adamently opposed to that. I don\\'t want the government financing congressional elections.MODERATOR: On that wonderful note of disagreement, we have to stop here and we want to go now to your closing statements. Governor Bush is first. You have two minutes.BUSH: Thank you, Jim. Thank the University of Massachusetts and Mr. Vice President, thank you. It has been a good, lively exchange. There is a huge difference of opinion. Mine is I want to empower people in their own lives. I also want to go to Washington to get some positive things done. It is going to require a new spirit. A spirit of cooperation. It will require the ability of a Republican president to reach out across the partisan divide and to say to Democrats, let\\'s come together to do what is right for America. It\\'s been my record as Governor of Texas, it will be how I conduct myself if I\\'m fortunate enough to earn your vote as President of the United States. I want to finally get something done on Medicare. I want to make sure prescription drugs are available for all seniors. And I want seniors to have additional choices when it comes to choosing their health care plans. I want to finally get something done on Social Security. I want to make sure the seniors have the promise made will be a promise kept, but I want younger workers to be able to manage some of their own money, some of their own payroll taxes in the private sector under certain guidelines to get a better rate of return on your own money. I want to rebuild our military to keep the peace. I want to have a strong hand when it comes to the United States in world affairs. I don\\'t want to try to put our troops in all places at all times. I don\\'t want to be the world\\'s policeman, I want to be the world\\'s peacemaker by having a military of high morale and a military that is well-equipped. I want anti-ballistic missile systems to protect ourselves and our allies from a rogue nation that may try to hold us hostage or blackmail our allies and friends. I want to make sure the education system fulfills its hope and promise. I\\'ve had a strong record of working with Democrats and Republicans in Texas to make sure no child is left behind. I understand the limited role of the federal government, but it could be a constructive role when it comes to reform, by insisting that there be a strong accountability systems. My intentions are to earn your vote and earn your confidence. I\\'m asking for your vote. I want you to be on my team. And for those of you working, thanks from the bottom of my heart. For those of you making up your mind, I would be honored to have your support.MODERATOR: Vice President Gore, two minutes.GORE: I want to thank everybody who watched and listened tonight because this is indeed a crucial time in American history. We\\'re at a fork in the road. We have this incredible prosperity, but a lot of people have been left behind. And we have a very important decision to make. Will we use the prosperity to enrich all of our families and not just a few? One important way of looking at this is to ask who are you going to fight for? Throughout my career in public service, I have fought for the working men and women of this country, middle-class families. Why? Because you are the ones who have the hardest time paying taxes, the hardest time making ends meet. You are the ones who are making car payments and mortgage payments and doing right by your kids. And a lot of times there are powerful forces that are against you. Make no mistake about it, they do have undue influence in Washington, D.C. and it makes a difference if you have a president who will fight for you. I know one thing about the position of president, it\\'s the only position in our Constitution that is filled by an individual who is given the responsibility to fight not just for one state or one district or the well-connected or wealthy, but to fight for all of the people, including especially those who most need somebody who will stand up and take on whatever powerful forces might stand in the way. There is a woman named Winifred Skinner here tonight from Iowa. I mentioned her earlier. She\\'s 79 years old. She has Social Security. I\\'m not going to cut her benefits or support any proposal that would. She gets a small pension, but in order to pay for her prescription drug benefits, she has to go out seven days a week several hours a day picking up cans. She came all the way from Iowa in a Winnebago with her poodle in order attend here tonight. I want to tell her, I\\'ll fight for a prescription drug benefit for all seniors and fight for the people of this country for a prosperity that benefits all.MODERATOR: We will continue this dialogue next week on October 11th at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. The format then will be more informal, more conversational with the two candidates seated at a table with me. The third will be October 17th at Washington University in St. Louis, and that will follow a town-hall type format. Also on the day after tomorrow, October 5, there is a 90-minute debate between the democratic nominee for vice president, Senator Joe Lieberman and the republican candidate for vice president former Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney. It will be held at Centre College in Danville, Kentucky. The moderator will be Bernard Shaw of CNN. Thank you, Governor Bush, Vice President Gore. See you next week. For now from Boston, I\\'m Jim Lehrer. Thank you, and good night.(APPLAUSE)',\n",
       " \"October 6, 1996 Debate TranscriptOctober 6, 1996The First Clinton-Dole Presidential DebateLEHRER: Good evening from the Bushnell Theatre in Hartford, Connecticut. I'm Jim Lehrer of the News Hour on PBS. Welcome to the first of the 1996 Presidential debates between President Bill Clinton, the Democratic nominee, and Senator Bob Dole, the Republican nominee. This event is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. It will last 90 minutes following a format and rules worked out by the two campaigns.There will be two-minute opening and closing statements. In between, a series of questions, each having three parts. A 90-second answer, a 60-second rebuttal, and a 30-second response. I will assist the candidates in adhering to those time limits with the help of a series of lights visible to both.Under their rules, the candidates are not allowed to question each other directly. I will ask the questions. There are no limitations on the subjects.The order for everything tonight was determined by coin toss. Now, to the opening statements and to President Clinton. Mr. President.CLINTON: Thank you, Jim. And thank you to the people of Hartford, our hosts.I want to begin by saying again how much I respect Senator Dole and his record of public service and how hard I will try to make this campaign and this debate one of ideas, not insults.Four years ago I ran for president at a time of high unemployment and rising frustration. I wanted to turn this country around with a program of opportunity for all, responsibility from all, and an American community where everybody has a role to play. I wanted a government that was smaller and less bureaucratic to help people make the most of their own lives. Four years ago you took me on faith. Now there's a record: Ten and a half million more jobs, rising incomes, falling crime rates and welfare rolls, a strong America at peace.We are better off than we were four years ago. Let's keep it going. We cut the deficit by 60 percent. Now, let's balance the budget and protect Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment. We cut taxes for 15 million working Americans. Now let's pass the tax cuts for education and child rearing, help with medical emergencies, and buying a home.We passed family and medical leave. Now let's expand it so more people can succeed as parents and in the work force. We passed 100,000 police, the assault weapons ban, the Brady Bill. Now let's keep going by finishing the work of putting the police on the street and tackling juvenile gangs.We passed welfare reform. Now let's move a million people from welfare to work. And most important, let's make education our highest priority so that every eight-year-old will be able to read, every 12-year-old can log onto the Internet, every 18-year-old can go to college. We can build that bridge to the 21st Century. And I look forward to discussing exactly how we're going to do it.LEHRER: Senator Dole, two minutes.DOLE: Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President, for those kind words. Thank the people of Hartford, the Commission, and all those out here who may be listening or watching.It's a great honor for me to be here standing here as the Republican nominee. I'm very proud to be the Republican nominee reaching out to Democrats and Independents.I have three very special people with me tonight: My wife, Elizabeth; my daughter, Robin, who has never let me down, and a fellow named Frank Carafa from New York, along with Ollie Manninen who helped me out in the mountains of Italy a few years back.I've learned from them that people do have tough times. And sometimes you can't go it alone. And that's what America is all about.I remember getting my future back from doctors and nurses and a doctor in Chicago named Dr. Kalikian . And ever since that time, I've tried to give something back to my country, to the people who are watching us tonight.America is the greatest place on the face of the earth. Now, I know millions of you still have anxieties. You work harder and harder to make ends meet and put food on the table. You worry about the quality and the safety of your children, and the quality of education. But even more importantly, you worry about the future and will they have the same opportunities that you and I have had.And Jack Kemp and I want to share with you some ideas tonight. Jack Kemp is my running mate, doing an outstanding job. Now, I'm a plain-speaking man and I learned long ago that your word was your bond. And I promise you tonight that I'll try to address your concerns and not try to exploit them. It's a tall order, but I've been running against the odds for a long time and, again, I'm honored to be here this evening.LEHRER: Mr. President, first question. There is a major difference in your view of the role of the Federal government and that of Senator Dole. How would you define the difference?CLINTON: Well, Jim, I believe that the Federal government should give people the tools and try to establish the conditions in which they can make the most of their own lives. That, to me, is the key. And that leads me to some different conclusions from Senator Dole.For example, we have reduced the size of the Federal government to its smallest size in 30 years. We reduced more regulations, eliminated more programs than my two Republican predecessors. But I have worked hard for things like the Family and Medical Leave Law, the Brady Bill, the assault weapons ban, the program to put 100,000 police on the street. All of these are programs that Senator Dole opposed that I supported, because I felt they were a legitimate effort to help people make the most of their own lives. I've worked hard to help families impart values to their own children. I supported the V-chip so that parents would be able to control what their kids watch on television when they're young, along with the ratings systems for television and educational television. I supported strong action against the tobacco companies to stop the marketing, advertising, and sale of tobacco to young people. I supported a big increase in the safe and drug-free schools program. These were areas on which Senator Dole and I differed, but I believed they were the right areas for America to be acting together as one country to help individuals and families make the most of their own lives and raise their kids with good values and a good future.LEHRER: Senator Dole, one minute.DOLE: I think the basic difference is, and I have had some experience in this, I think the basic difference, I trust the people. The President trusts the government. We go back and look at the healthcare plan that he wanted to impose on the American people. One seventh the total economy, 17 new taxes, price controls, 35 to 50 new bureaucracies that cost $1.5 trillion. Don't forget that, that happened in 1993. A tax increase, a tax on everybody in America. Not just the rich. If you made 25,000 as the original proposal, you got your Social Security taxes increased. We had a BTU tax we turned into a $35 million gas tax, a $265 billion tax increase.I guess I rely more on the individual. I carry a little card in my pocket called the Tenth Amendment. Where possible, I want to give power back to the states and back to the people. That's my difference with the President. We'll have specific differences later. He noted a few, but there are others.LEHRER: Mr. President, 30 seconds.CLINTON: I trust the people. We've done a lot to give the people more powers to make their own decisions over their own lives. But I do think we are right when we try to, for example, give mothers and newborns 48 hours before they can be kicked out of the hospital, ending these drive-by deliveries.I think we were right to pass the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill, which says you can't lose your health insurance just because you change jobs or because someone in your family's been sick. Our government is smaller and less bureaucratic and has given more authority to the states than its two predecessors under Republican presidents. But I do believe we have to help our people get ready to succeed in the 21st Century.LEHRER: Senator Dole, the President said in his opening statement we are better off today than we were four years ago. Do you agree?DOLE: Well, he's better off than he was four years ago.CLINTON: I agree with that. That's right.DOLE: And I may be better off four years from now, but I don't know. I looked at the slowest growth in the century. He inherited a growth of 4.7 4.8 percent, now it's down to about 2.4 percent. We're going to pass a million bankruptcies this year for the first time in history. We've got stagnant wages. In fact, women's wages have dropped 2.2 percent. Men's wages haven't gone up, gone down. So we have stagnation.We have the highest foreign debt in history. And it seems to me that if you take a look, are you better off? Well, I guess some may be better off. Saddam Hussein is probably better off than he was four years ago. Renee Proval (ph) is probably better off than he was four years ago. But are the American people? They're working harder and higher and harder paying more taxes. For the first time in history, you pay about 40 percent of what you earn. More than you spend for food, clothing and shelter combined for taxes under this administration. So some may be better off.They talk about family income being up. That's not true in Connecticut, family income is down. And it's up in some cases because both parents are working. One works for the family, and one works to pay taxes for the government. We're going to give them tax cuts so they can spend more time with their children, maybe even take a vacation. That's what America is all about.LEHRER: One minute, Mr. President.CLINTON: Well, let me say, first of all, in February Senator Dole acknowledged that the American economy was in the best shape it's been in in 30 years. We have ten and a half million more jobs, a faster job growth rate than under any Republican administration since the 1920s. Wages are goings up for the first time in a decade. We have record numbers of new small businesses. We have the biggest drop in the number of people in poverty in 27 years. All groups of people are growing. We had the biggest drop in income inequality in 27 years in 1995.The average family's income has gone up over $1600 just since our economic plan passed. So I think it's clear that we're better off than we were four years ago. Now we need to focus on what do we need to do to be better off still. How can we help people as we are to get their retirements when they work for small businesses, to be able to afford health insurance, to be able to educate their children. That's what I want to focus on. But we are clearly better off than we were four years ago, as Senator Dole acknowledged this year.LEHRER: Senator Dole.DOLE: I doubt that I acknowledged that this year. But in any event, I think we just look at the facts. We ask the people that are viewing tonight, are you better off than you were four years ago. It's not whether we're better off, it's whether they're better off.Are you working harder to put food on the table, feed your children. Are your children getting a better education. Drug use has doubled the past 44 months all across America. Crime has gone down but it's because the mayors like Rudy Giuliani where one third of the drop happened in one city, New York City.So, yes, some may be better off. But of the people listening tonight, the working families who will benefit from economic packages, they'll be better off when Bob Dole is president and Jack Kemp is vice president.LEHRER: Mr. President, Senator Dole has come pretty close in the last few days to accusing you of lying about his position on Medicare reform. Have you done so?CLINTON: Absolutely not. Let's look at the position. First of all, remember that in this campaign season, since Senator Dole's been a candidate, he has bragged about the fact that he voted against Medicare in the beginning, in 1965, one of only 12 members. He said he did the right thing then, he knew it wouldn't work at the time. That's what he said.Then his budget that he passed along with Speaker Gingrich cut Medicare $270 billion, more than was necessary to repair the Medicare trust fund. It would have charged seniors more for out-of-pocket costs as well as more in premiums because doctors could have charged them more. The American Medical, Hospital Association, the Nurses Association, the Catholic Hospital Association all said hundreds of hospitals could close and people would be hurt badly under the Dole-Gingrich Medicare plan that I vetoed.And now with this risky $550 billion tax scheme of Senator Dole's, even his own friends, his campaign co-chair, Senator D'Amato, says that they can't possibly pay for it without cutting Medicare more and cutting Social Security as well, according to him.Now, my balanced budget plan adds ten years to the life of the Medicare trust fund, ten years. And we'll have time to deal with the long-term problems of the baby boomers. But it was simply wrong to finance their last scheme to cut Medicare $270 billion to run the risk of it withering on the vine. We always had to reform it over the years, but we need somebody who believes it in to reform it.LEHRER: Senator Dole.DOLE: Well, I must say, I look back at the vote on Medicare in 1965, we had a program called Eldercare that also provided drugs and means tests to people who needed medical attention received it. I thought it was a good program. But I've supported Medicare ever since.In fact, I used to go home, my mother would tell me, Bob, all I've got is my Social Security and my Medicare, don't cut it. I wouldn't violate anything my mother said. In fact, we had a conversation about our mothers one day, a very poignant conversation in the White House. I'm concerned about healthcare. I've had the best healthcare from government hospitals, Army hospitals and I know its importance, but we've got to fix it. It's his trustees, the President's trustees, not mine, who says it's going to go broke. He doesn't fix it for ten years. We ought to appoint a commission, just as we did in Social Security in 1983, when we rescued Social Security, and I was proud to be on that commission, along with Claude Pepper, the champion of senior citizens from Florida. And we can do it again, if we take politics out of it. Stop scaring the seniors, Mr. President. You've already spent $45 million scaring seniors and tearing me apart. I think it's time to have a truce.LEHRER: Mr. President.CLINTON: Well, let me say, first of all, I'd be happy to have a commission deal with this and I appreciate what Senator Dole did on the '83 Social Security commission. But it won't be possible to do, if his tax scheme passes because even his own campaign co-chair, Senator D'Amato, says he'll have to cut Medicare even more than was cut in the bill that I vetoed. I vetoed that bill because it cut more Medicare and and basically ran the risk of breaking up the system. My balanced budget plan puts ten years on the Medicare. We ought to do that, then we can have a commission. But Senator Dole's plans are not good for the country.LEHRER: Senator Dole, speaking of your tax plan, do you still think that's a good idea, the 15 percent across the board tax cut?DOLE: Oh, yes. And you'll be eligible.CLINTON: Me too?DOLE: And so will the former President, yes.CLINTON: I need it.DOLE: Well, the people need it, that's the point. This is not a Wall Street tax cut. This is a family tax cut. This is a Main Street tax cut, 15 percent across -- let's take a family making $30,000 a year, that's $1261. Now, maybe to some in this Bushnell Memorial that it's not a lot of money, but people watching tonight with a couple of kids, a working family, that's four or five months of day care, maybe a personal computer; it's may be three or four months of mortgage payments. This economic package is about families but it's a six-point package. First of all, it's a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution which President Clinton defeated. He twisted arms and got six Democrats to vote the other way, but we lost by one vote. It's balancing a budget by the year 2002. It's a tax cut, cutting capital gains 50 percent. So you can go out and create more jobs and more opportunities. It's a state tax relief. It's a $500 per child tax credit. It's about litigation reforms.Now that the President gets millions of dollars from the trial lawyers, he probably doesn't like this provision. In fact, when I fell off the podium in Chico, before I lit the ground, hit the ground I had call on my cell phone from a trial lawyer saying I think we've got a case here. And it's also regulatory reform. It's a good package, Mr. President. We'd like to have your support.LEHRER: Mr. President.CLINTON: Well, here's the problem with it: It sounds very good, but there's a reason that 500 economists, including seven Nobel prize winners and business periodicals like Business Week, and even Senator Dole's friends, Senator Warren Rudman, former Republican senator from New Hampshire, says it's not a practical program. It's a $550 billion tax scheme that will cause a big hole in the deficit which will raise interest rates and slow down the economy and cause people to pay more for home mortgages, car payments, credit card payments, college loans, and small business loans. It's not good to raise the deficit. We worked too hard to lower it. It will actually raise taxes on nine million people and, in addition to that, it will force bigger cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment than the ones that he and Mr. Gingrich passed that I vetoed last year. So it sounds great, but our targeted tax cut for education, child rearing, healthcare and home buying, which is paid for in my balanced budget plan, something that he has not done, certified by the Congressional budget office, that's the right way to go.DOLE: The President wants to increase spending 20 percent over the next six years. I want to increase spending 14 percent, that's how simple it is. I want the government to pinch pennies for a change instead of the American families. We're talking about six percentage points over six years, and with that money you give it back to the working people. You also provide opportunity scholarships so low income parents will have the same choice that others have in sending their children to better schools. It will work, and when it does work, Mr. President, I know you'll congratulate me.LEHRER: Mr. President, the Senator mentioned trial lawyers and campaign, that means campaign financing. How do you personally avoid being unduly influenced by people who give you money or give you services in your campaigns?CLINTON: Well, I try to articulate my positions as clearly as possible, tell people what I stand for and let them decide whether they're going to support me or not.The Senator mentioned the trial lawyers. In the case of the product liability bill, which they passed and I vetoed, I think that's what he's talking about, I actually wanted to sign that bill. And I told the people exactly what the Congress exactly what kind of bill I would sign. Now, a lot of the trial lawyers didn't want me to sign any bill at all, but I had thought we ought to do what we could to cut frivolous lawsuits, but they wouldn't make some of the changes that I thought should be made.Now, let me just give you an example. I had a person in the Oval Office who lost a child in a school bus accident where a drunk driver caused the accident directly, but there were problems with the school bus. The drunk driver had no money. Under the new bill, if I had signed it, a person like that could never have had any recovery. I thought that was wrong. So I gave four or five specific examples to the Congress and said, prove to me that these people could recover but we're going to eliminate frivolous lawsuits, I'll sign the bill. But generally I believe that a president has to be willing to do what he thinks is right. I've done a lot of things that were controversial. My economic plan, my trade position, Bosnia, Haiti, taking on the NRA for the first time, taking on the tobacco companies for the first time. Sometimes you just have to do that because you know it's right for the country over the long run. That's what I've tried to do and that's what I will continue to do as president.LEHRER: Senator Dole.DOLE: How does he avoid conflict? Well, I don't know in the case of the trial lawyers. I look at the trial lawyers, and when you're a few million short, you run out to Hollywood and pick up two to four million and organized labor comes to Washington, D.C. and puts 35 million into the pot. Now, if these aren't special interests, I've got a lot to learn. I was there for a while before I left on June the 11th. The trial lawyers and I don't -- you know, my wife's a lawyer. We're the only two lawyers in Washington that trust each other. But we're lawyers, I like lawyers. I don't dislike trial lawyers. But it seemed to me there's got to be some end to the frivolous lawsuits and there's got to be some cap on punitive damage. You're putting a lot of business people out of business. Small businessmen and businesswomen who paid 70 percent of your ninteen , your$265 billion tax increase, the largest tax increase in the history of America. I said that one day and Pat Moynihan, a Democrat, say, no, he said, in the history of the world. So I modified it, the largest tax increase in the history of the world. And it seems to me that there is a problem there, Mr. President. And I will address you as Mr. President. You didn't do that with Mr. with President Bush in 1992.LEHRER: Mr. President.CLINTON: Let me say, first of all, I signed a tort reform bill that dealt with civilian aviation a couple of years ago. I proved that I will sign reasonable tort reform. Secondly, Senator Dole had some pretty harsh comments about special interest money, but it wasn't me who opposed what we tried to do to save the lives of children who were subject to tobacco and then went to the tobacco growers and bragged about standing up for the Federal government when we tried to stop the advertising, marketing, and sales of tobacco to children. And it wasn't me that let the polluters actually come into the halls of Congress, into the rooms, and rewrite the environmental laws. That's what Speaker Gingrich and Senator Dole did, not me.DOLE: That's not true.CLINTON: So I believe that we should take a different approach to this and talk about how we stand on the issues instead of trying to characterize each other's motivations. I think Senator Dole and I just honestly disagree.LEHRER: Well, Senator Dole, let me ask you the same question I asked the President: How do you avoid being influenced by people who contribute money and services to your campaigns?DOLE: I think it's very difficult. Let's be honest about it. That's why we need campaign finance reform. That's why I reach out to the Perot voters. We've done about all, we are the reform party, the Republican Party. And the Perot voters that are looking for a home ought to take a look at the Republican record. Whatever it is, whatever the checklist was in '92, it's all done with campaign finance reform. I worked with Senator Mitchell, who played me, I guess, in the debate warmup. We tried six or eight years ago. He appointed three people, I appointed three people to get campaign finance reform. We couldn't get it done, because I wasn't enforceable.You've suggested a commission, Newt Gingrich did, I suggested that at least four or five years ago. We have a commission on campaign finance reform. They send it to Congress, and we have to vote it up or down. That's how it works. We are never going to fix it by the parties, because Democrats want a better advantage for themselves, we want a better advantage as Republicans, and that's not how it's going to work.But I want to touch on this is tobacco thing. I know the President's been puffing a lot on that. But I want to go back to 1965. That was my first vote against tobacco companies when I said we ought to label cigarettes. And I've had a consistent record ever since 1965. We passed a bill in 1992 that encouraged the states to adopt programs to stop kids from smoking. All 50 states did it. It took three and a half years. It wasn't until election year, Mr. President, that you ever thought about stopping smoking.What about drugs that have increased, doubled in the last 44 months? Cocaine is up 141 percent -- marijuana, cocaine up 166 percent. It seems to me that you have a selective memory. You know, mine doesn't work that way. So I just want to try to correct it as we go along.CLINTON: Mr. Lehrer, I hope we'll have a chance to discuss drugs later in the program. But let me respond to what you said. I agree that too many incumbent politicians in Washington in both parties have consistently opposed campaign finance reform. That was certainly the case from the minute I got there. So after Speaker Gingrich and Senator Dole took over the Congress, I went to New Hampshire and a man suggested -- a gentleman that unfortunately just passed away a couple of days ago, suggested that we appoint a commission. And I shook hands with him on it and I appointed my members, and the commission never met. And then Senator Dole's ardent supporters, Senator McCain, who's out there today, along with Senator Feingold, supported, sponsored a campaign finance reform proposal. I strongly supported it. And members of Senator Dole's own party in the Senate killed it. And he was not out there urging them to vote for the McCain-Feingold bill. So I think the American people, including the Perot supporters, know that I have had a consistent record in favor of campaign finance reform, and I will continue to have. And I hope we can finally get it in the next session of Congress, because we need it badly.LEHRER: Senator Dole, 30 seconds.DOLE: Well, on campaign reform itself, we're going to get it when we have a bipartisan commission, take it out of politics. Get people who don't have any interest in politics but understand the issue and let them make the recommendation to Congress. Now, we're now kidding anybody, Mr. President. These are sophisticated people watching tonight. Millions and millions of Americans. They know the Republican Party hasn't done it. They know the Democratic party won't do it. We ought to agree that somebody else should do it. And we have to vote it up or down, Mr. President.LEHRER: Mr. President, the Senator mentioned drugs. He suggested that you are -- you bear some responsibility for the rise in drug use of teenagers in the United States. Is he right?CLINTON: Well, Jim, I think every American in any position of responsibility should be concerned about what's happened. I am. But let's look at the overall record. Overall in America cocaine use has dropped 30 percent in the last four years, casual drug use down 13 percent. The tragedy is that our young people are still increasing their use of drugs up to about 11 percent total with marijuana, and I regret it. Let me tell you what I tried to do about it. I appointed a four-star general who led our efforts south of the border to keep drugs from coming into the country as our nation's drug czar. The most heavily directed, decorated solder in uniform when he retired. We submitted the biggest drug budget ever. We have dramatically increased control and enforcement at the border. We supported a a crime bill that had 60 death penalties including, including the death penalty for drug kingpins. And I supported a big expansion in safe and drug-free schools program to support things like the DARE program because I thought all those things were very important. Do I think that I bear some responsibility for the fact that too many of our children still don't understand drugs are wrong, drugs can kill you. Even though I have consistently opposed the legalization of drugs all my public life and worked hard against them. I think we all do. And I hope we can do better. I don't think this issue should be politicized because my record is clear and I don't think Senator Dole supports using using drugs. I think we just have to continue to work on this until those who think it isn't dangerous and won't kill them and won't destroy their lives, get the message and change.LEHRER: Senator.DOLE: Again, well it's, you are very selective, Mr. President. You don't want to politicize drugs, but it's already politicized Medicare, go out and scare senior citizens and other vulnerable groups, veterans and people who get Pell Grants and things like this. I mean, you say we've done all these bad things, which isn't the case. But it seems to me the record is clear. The record is pretty clear in Arkansas, when you were governor. Drug use doubled. You resisted the appointment of a drug czar there because you thought it might interfere with treatment. But here you cut the drug czar's office 83 percent. You cut interdiction substantially. I mean that's what, I want to stop it from coming across the border. And in my administration, we're going to train the National Guard to stop it from coming across the border. This is a invasion of drugs from all over the world. And we have a responsibility. You had a surgeon -- or before General McCaffrey (ph) you had a lady who said we ought to consider legalizing drugs. Is that the kind of leadership we need? And I won't comment on other things that happened in your administration or your past about drugs. But it seems to me the kids ought to -- if they've started, they ought to stop and just don't do it.LEHRER: Mr. President.CLINTON: Let me say again, we did have a drug czar in Arkansas, but he answered to the governor, just like this one answers to the President. That's what I thought we ought to do.Secondly, Senator Dole, you voted against the crime bill that had the death penalty for drug kingpins in it. And you voted to cut services to 23 million school children under the safe and drug-free schools act. I don't think that means you're soft on drugs. We just have a different approach. But let me remind you, my family has suffered from drug abuse. I know what it's like to see somebody you love nearly lose their lives, and I hate drugs, Senator. We need to do this together and we can.LEHRER: Senator Dole, on the government, continuing to talk about the government's role. If elected President, would you seek to repeal the Brady Bill and the ban on assault weapons?DOLE: Not if I didn't have a better idea. But I've got a better idea. It's something I've worked on for 15 years. It's called the automated check or the instant check. It's being used in 17 states right now. States like Florida, Colorado, Virginia, and other states. You don't buy any gun. You don't get any gun. We've got 20 million names on a computer in Washington, D.C. of people who should not have guns. We ought to keep guns out of the hands of criminals. And, there are eight other categories that should not have guns. I've been working on this for a long, long time. You walk in, you put your little card in there. If it says tilt, you don't get any gun. You don't get a hand gun, you don't get a rifle, you don't get a shot gun, you get zippo.If we're going to protect American children and American families and people who live as prisoners in their own home, we've got to stop guns from being dumped on the street.The administration says they support the instant check. They've appropriated about $200 million, but only spent about $3 million to get it underway. In our administration, in my administration, we will expedite. This keeps up with technology. It keeps guns out of the hands of people who should not have guns. That is the bottom line. And I believe it's a good idea, has strong bipartisan support. And perhaps that's another thing we can depoliticize.You talk about the Brady Bill. There has only been one prosecution under the Brady -- only one under the assault weapon ban and only seven under the Brady Bill that you talk about all the time. And on the assault weapon ban, out of 17 weapons that were banned, only six banned now because eleven have been modified and are back on the street. Let's get together on this instant check because that will really make a difference.LEHRER: Mr. President.CLINTON: Let me say, first of all, Senator Dole has gone back and forth about whether he'd be for repealing the Brady Bill or repealing the assault weapons ban. And I think his present position is he would not do so, and if that's true I'm grateful for it. But let's look at the facts here. The Brady Bill has kept at least 60,000 felons, fugitives and stalkers from getting hand guns. Senator Dole led the fight against the Brady Bill. He tried to keep it from coming to my desk. He didn't succeed and I signed it and I'm glad I did.Then when we had the assault weapons ban in the Senate, Senator Dole fought it bitterly and opposed the entire crime bill and almost brought the entire crime bill down because the National Rifle Association didn't want the assault weapons ban, just like they didn't want the Brady Bill. But two years later nobody's lost their handguns. I mean, their rifles. We've expanded the Brady Bill to cover people who beat up their spouses and their kids. And this is a safer country. So I'm glad I took on that fight and I believe, with all respect, I was right and he was wrong.DOLE: Well, the President doesn't have it quite right. I mean, it seemed to me at the time the assault weapon ban was not effective. But that's history. I told the NRA that's history. You're not going to worry about it anymore. I'm not going to worry about it anymore. Let's do something better. Let's stop, you know, playing the political game, Mr. President. Talking about this and this. You add all the states that've used the instant check and how many weapons they keep, kept out of the hands of criminals. It would far surpass the numbers you mentioned. So in my view, if you want to be protected, you ought to vote for Bob Dole and we'll get the instant check passed and we'll keep guns out of the hands of criminals.LEHRER: Mr. President, Senator Dole said the other day that you practiced a photo-op foreign policy that has lessened the credibility of the United States throughout the world. Is he wrong about that?CLINTON: If he, that's what he said, he's not right about that. Look at where we are today. The United States is still the indispensable nation in the aftermath of the Cold War and on the brink of the 21st Century. I have worked to support our country as the world's strongest force for peace and freedom, prosperity and security.We have done the following things: Number one, we've managed the aftermath of the Cold War, supporting a big drop in nuclear weapons in Russia. The removal of Russian troops from the Baltics. The integration of Central and Eastern European democracies into a new partnership with NATO. And, I might add, with the democratic Russia.There are no nuclear missiles pointed at the children of the United States tonight and have not been in our administration for the first time since the dawn of the nuclear age.We have worked hard for peace and freedom. When I took office, Haiti was governed by a dictator that had defied the United States. When I took office, the worst war in Europe was waging in Bosnia. Now there is a the democratically elected president in Haiti. Peace in Bosnia. We just had the election there. We've made progress in Northern Ireland, in the Middle East. We've also stood up to the new threats of terrorism. The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, organized crime, and we have worked hard to expand America's economic presence around the world with the biggest increase in trade with the largest new number of trade agreements in history And that's one of the reasons America is number one in auto production again.LEHRER: Senator.DOLE: Well, I have a different view. Again, Iâ€™ve supported the President on Bosnia, and I think we were told the troops would be out in a year. Now I understand it's been extended 'til some time next year. But, let's start with Somalia, where they dragged Americans through the streets, and where 18 Americans were killed one day, because they didn't have, they were pinned down for eight hours, the rangers. They didn't have the weapons, they didn't have the tanks. They asked for the tanks. They didn't get the tanks from this administration because we were nation building. It's called mission creep. We turn it over to the United Nations. The President didn't have much to do about it. You look at Haiti, where we spend about three billion dollars and we got an alarm call there about two weeks ago. You got to send down some more people, because the president's found out there are death squads on his on his, in his own property. So we need more protection from America. Bosnia, Northern Ireland. There's no ceasefire in Bosnia. I think there are still lot of problems in Bosnia. We agreed to train and arm the Muslims so they could defend themselves, the policy you had when you ran in 1992. We haven't done that. We're way behind, which means Americans can't come home. Americans shouldn't have gone there in the first place, had we let them defend themselves, as they have a right to do under Article 57 of the United Nations charter.LEHRER: Mr. President.CLINTON: First of all, I take full responsibility for what happened in Somalia, but the American people must remember that those soldiers were under an American commander when that happened. I believe they did the best they could under the circumstances, and let's not forget that hundreds of thousands of lives were saved there.Secondly, in Haiti, political violence is much, much smaller than it was. Thirdly, in Bosnia it's a virtual miracle that there has been no return to war and at least there has now been an election. And institutions are beginning to function.In Northern Ireland, in the Middle East we are better off than we were four years ago. There will always be problems in this whole world. But if we're moving in the right direction and America is leading, we're better off.LEHRER: Senator Dole, if elected president, what criteria would you use to decide when to send U.S. troops into harm's way.DOLE: Well it, after World War I, we had, you know, a policy of disengagement. Then from World War I to World War II we had sort of a compulsory engagement policy. Now I think we have a selective engagement policy. We have to determine when our interests are involved, not the United Nations' interests. And many of the things the President talked about, he turned over to the United Nations. They decided.He's deployed more troops than any president in history around the world. It's cost us billions and billions of dollars for peace-keeping operations. Look these are facts. And it seems to me that when you make a decision, the decision is made by the President of the United States, by the Commander-in-Chief. He makes that decision when he commits young men or young women who are going to go round and defend our liberty and our freedom. That would be my position.Then I'm going to have a top down review at the Pentagon, not a bottom up review. We all fight over how much money is there. I want a top down review to determine what our priorities are and what we should do in defense, and then follow that policy instead of this bottom up review with all the services fighting for the money. You know, the President said he was going to cut defense $60 billion, he cut defense $112 billion. Devastated states like California and others. And I think now we've got a problem. We've got to go back and look. It's just like you said in Texas one day, you know raised taxes too much, and you did, and you cut defense too much, Mr. President, and you did. You may have said that, too.But the bottom line is, we are the strongest nation in the world. We provide the leadership and we're going to have to continue to provide the leadership, but let's do it on our terms when our interests are involved and not when somebody blows the whistle at the United Nations.CLINTON: Our military is the strongest military in the world. It is the strongest, best prepared, best equipped it has ever been. There is very little difference in the budget that I proposed and the Republican budget over the next six-year period. We are spending a lot of money to modernize our weapons system. I have proposed a lot of new investments to improve the quality of life for our soldiers, for our men and women in uniform, for their families, for their training. That is my solemn obligation.You ask when do you decide to deploy them. The interests of the American people must be at stake. Our values must be at stake. We have to be able to make a difference. And frankly we have to consider what the risks are to our young men and women in uniform. But I believe the evidence is that our deployments have been successful, in Haiti, in Bosnia, when we moved to Kuwait to repel Saddam Hussein's threatened invasion of Kuwait. When I have sent the fleet into the Taiwan straits. When we've worked hard to end the Northern Korean nuclear threat.I believe the United States is at peace tonight in part because of the disciplined, careful, effective deployment of our military resources.LEHRER: Senator Dole.DOLE: Well I failed to mention North Korea and Cuba, a while ago. You look at North Korea where they have enough plutonium to build six nuclear bombs. We've sort of distanced ourselves from our ally, South Korea. They lost about a million people in the war, the Korean War, the forgotten war. We lost 53,000 Americans.We shouldn't be doing any favors for North Korea. It's a closed society. We don't have any inspection. We don't know whether it's going to work or not, but we keep giving the incentives. Someone called them something else. Incentives. We don't know what's going to happen. Here we have Cuba 90 miles from our shores, and what have we done, we passed the law that gave people a right to sue and the President postponed it for six months. And it seemed to me if you want to send a signal, you've got to send a signal, Mr. President. The sooner the better off we'll be, if you put tougher sanctions on Castro, not try to make it easier for him.LEHRER: Mr. President, what is your attitude toward Cuba and how Cuba should be treated?CLINTON: Well, first of all, for the last four years we have worked had to put more and more pressure on the Castro government to bring about more openness and move toward democracy. In 1992, before I became President, the Congress passed the Cuba Democracy Act and I enforced it vigorously. We made the embargo tougher but we increased contacts people to people with the Cubans, including direct telephone service, which was largely supported by the Cuban-American community. Then Cuba shot down two of our planes and murdered four people in international air space. They were completely beyond the pale of the law, and I signed the Helms-Burton legislation. Senator Dole is correct. I did give about six months before the effective date of the act before lawsuits can actually be filed, even though they're effective now, and can be legally binding, because I want to change Cuba. And the United States needs help from other countries.Nobody in the world agrees with our policy on Cuba now. But this law can be used as leverage to get other countries to help us to move Cuba to democracy. Every single country in Latin America, Central America and the Caribbean is a democracy tonight but Cuba. And if we stay firm and strong, we will be able to bring Cuba around as well.DOLE: That's the point I made. We have to be firm and strong. And I hope that will happen. It will happen starting next January and maybe it can happen the balance of this year. We have not been firm and strong. You look at the poor people who still live in Cuba. It's a haven for drug smugglers and we don't have a firm policy when it comes to Fidel Castro. In my view, the policy has failed.So Congress passes the law, the President signs it, like he does a lot of things. But he, like welfare reform, I'm going to sign it but I'm going to try to change it next year. A lot of these election-year conversions, the President talks about the drug money, and all the other things, all this antismoking campaign all happened in 1996.And I think the people viewing out there ought to go back and take a look at the record when he fought a balanced budget amendment. When he gave you that biggest tax increase in history; when he tried to take over your healthcare system. When he fought regulatory reform that cost the average family 6 to $7,000 a year. This is a serious business. It's about your family; it's about your business, and in this case it's about a firmer policy with Cuba.CLINTON: There were several off-the-subject quaffers in that litany. Let me just mention, Senator Dole voted for $900 billion in tax increases. His running mate Jack Kemp once said that Bob Dole never met a tax he didn't hike. And everybody knows, including the Wall Street Journal, hardly a friend of the Democratic party of this administration, that the '82 tax increase he sponsored in inflation-adjusted dollars was the biggest tax increase in American history. So we ought to at least get the facts out here on the table so we can know where to go from here.LEHRER: Senator Dole, you mentioned health reform several times. What do you think should be done about the healthcare system?DOLE: Let me first answer that question about the 1982 tax cut. We were closing loopholes, we were going after big corporations. I know you probably would oppose it, Mr. President, but I think we should have a fairer system and a flatter system, and we'll have a fairer and flatter system and we're going to make the economic package work. Healthcare. Well, we finally passed the Kassebaum bill. The President was opposed to it in 1993. He wanted to give us this big system, that took over about one-seventh of the economy, that put on price controls, created all these state alliances, and would cost $1.5 trillion and force people into managed care, whether they wanted it or not. Most people want to see their own doctor. They're going to see their own doctor when Bob Dole is president. We won't threaten anybody.So we passed the Kassebaum-Kennedy, the Kennedy Kassebaum bill that will cover about 20 to 25 million people. We've been for that for four, five, six years. The President held it up. And even when it finally got near passage, Senator Kennedy held it up for 100 days, because he wasn't satisfied with one provision. But it will cover preexisting conditions. If you change your job, you're going to be covered. So there are a lot of good things in this bill we should have done instead of trying this massive, massive takeover by the Federal government. But then of course we had a Democratic Congress and they didn't want to do that. Until we got a Republican Congress, we finally got action, I'm proud of my colleagues in the Republican Party for getting that done. It means a lot to a lot of people watching us tonight.CLINTON: Well, that sounds very good, but it's very wrong. Senator Dole remembers well that we actually offered not to even put in a healthcare bill in 1994, uh '93, but instead to work with the Senate Republicans and write a joint bill. And they said no because they got a memo from one of their political advisers saying that instead they should characterize whatever we did as big government and make sure nothing was done to aid healthcare before the '94 elections so they could make that claim. Well, maybe we bit off more than we could chew, but we're pursuing a step-by-step reform now. The Kennedy-Kassebaum bill that I signed will make it possible for 25 million people to keep their health insurance when they change jobs or when somebody in their family's been sick. I signed a bill to stop these drive-by deliveries when insurance companies can force people out of the hospital after 24 hours and I vetoed Senator Dole's Medicare plan that would have forced a lot of seniors into managed care and taken a lot more money out of their pockets and led to Medicare withering on the vine.DOLE: Well, many of the provisions in the Kassebaum bill were provisions that -- my provisions, like deductions for long-term care, making certain that self-employed people that are watching tonight can deduct not 30 percent but 80 percent of you pay for premiums. You can also deduct long-term care now, so it's a good it's a good start. I think there's enough -- we're even looking at our tax cut proposal, our economic package. There may be a way of reaching out to the uninsured, because there are a lot of uninsured people in the country, particularly children, that should be covered. Another way you can do is to expand Medicaid. In America no one will go without healthcare, no one will go without food.LEHRER: Senator, go ahead and finish your sentence.DOLE: All right. Food.LEHRER: Back to foreign affairs for a moment, Mr. President. Are you satisfied with the way you handled this last Iraq crisis and the end result?CLINTON: Well, I believe that we did the appropriate thing under the circumstances. Saddam Hussein is under a U.N. resolution not to threaten his neighbors or threaten his own, repress his own citizens. Unfortunately, a lot of people, have never been as concerned about the Kurds as the United States has tried to be, and we've been flying an operation to protect them out of Turkey for many years now. What happened was one of the Turkish, one of the Kurdish leaders invited him to go up north, but we felt since the whole world community had told him not to do it, that once he did it we had to do something. We did not feel that I could commit. I certainly didn't feel I should commit American troops to throw him out of where he had gone, and that was the only way to do that. So the appropriate thing strategically to do was to reduce his ability to threaten his neighbors. We did that by expanding what's called the no-fly zone by increasing our allies' control of the air space now from the Kuwait border to the suburbs of Baghdad. Was it the right thing to do? I believe it was. Is it fully effective? Did it make him withdraw from the north? Well, he does , he has a little bit, and I hope he will continue. We have learned that you give him an inch he'll take a mile. We had to do something, and even though not all of our allies supported it at first, I think most of them now believe that what we did was an appropriate thing to do.LEHRER: Senator Dole.DOLE: Well, the president's own CIA director says Saddam is stronger now than he was. I don't understand extending the no-fly zone in the south when the trouble was in the north. And what we've done during the Bush administration, the Kurds were at the State Department, negotiating, trying to work their differences out. Now we've got all thousands and thousands of refugees. We're even shipping 3,000 Kurds to Guam. It involves Turkey. It's a real problem. Saddam is probably about as strong as he ever was. We shot, what, 44 cruise missiles, worth about a million-two a piece, and hit some radar, that repaired in a couple, three days. Did we inflict any damage? No. Did we have any allies helping? Well, we have Great Britain. They're always very loyal to us, and I appreciate that. And of course Kuwait. Even though they had to find out they had 5,000 troops coming, they didn't even understand that. We had to get their permission. The bottom line is, we went in there alone. We are supposed to be operating under a U.N. resolution. We did it without any of our allies that helped in the Gulf.CLINTON: Senator Dole has two or three times before tonight criticized me for working with the U.N. Now I'm being criticized for not working with the U.N.DOLE: It's not the U.N.CLINTON: Sometimes the United States has to act alone or at least has to act first. Sometimes we cannot let other countries have a veto on our foreign policy. I could not send soldiers into the north of Iraq, that would have been wrong. It could reduce Saddam Hussein's abilities to threaten Kuwait and his other neighbors again. That's what I did. I still believe it was the right thing to do.LEHRER: Senator Dole, on your photo-op foreign policy charge against the President --DOLE: Not mine.LEHRER: Oh, No, no. I mean your charge against the President, that he has a photo-op foreign policy. Does the Middle East summit last week fall into that category?DOLE: Well, there were some good pictures, but does it fall into that category? I don't know. I want to be very serious. I've supported the President when I thought he was right on Bosnia. I supported him on NAFTA and GATT. So it's not that we always disagree. Others disagreed with us.The Mideast is very difficult. But it seemed to me just as an observer that you know before you'd call somebody to America, you'd have some notion what the end result might be. Now maybe it's better just to get together and sit down and talk. Maybe that was the purpose. And I know talks have started again today. But again it's almost like an ad hoc foreign policy. It's ad hoc, it's sort of we get up in the morning and read the papers, what country's in trouble, we'll have a meeting.Now, to me that's not the strategy that I think people expect from America. I think we have lost credibility, and I say this very honestly without any partisanship. We've lost credibility around the world. Our allies know, -- they're not certain what we're going to do, what our reaction, what our response is going to be. Nobody suggested sending troops to Iraq, if that was the hint there from the President. But I do think that Saddam Hussein is stronger than he was. And I do believe that we didn't gain a great deal in the Mideast by bringing three of the four leaders, one refused to come, to Washington D.C.CLINTON: We have a very consistent policy in the Middle East: It is to support the peace process; to support the security of Israel; and to support those who are prepared to take risks for peace. It is a very difficult environment. The feelings are very strong. There are extremists in all parts of the Middle East who want to kill that peace process. Prime Minister Rabin gave his life because someone in his own country literally hated him for trying to bring peace. I would like to have had a big, organized summit, but those people were killing each other, rapidly, innocent Arab children, innocent Israeli people, they were dying. And there is ,so much trust has broken down in the aftermath of the change of government. I felt that if I could just get the parties together to say let's stop the violence, start talking, commit to the negotiations, that would be a plus.Now today the Secretary of State is in the Middle East and they've started negotiations and all those leaders promised me they would not quit until they resolved the issues between them and got the peace process going forward again.LEHRER: Senator Dole.DOLE: Well, I was disappointed. The President has not called for an unconditional end to the violence. It seemed to me the violence stopped when these leaders came to America. The killing and tragedies had taken place. And it is unfortunate, it is a difficult area, no doubt about it. It shouldn't be politicized in any way by the President or by his opponent. And I don't intend to politicize it. I hope they talked and I hope they've reached some result and that the killing will end.CLINTON: Thank you.LEHRER: Mr. President, in your acceptance speech in Chicago, you said the real choice in this race is, quote, whether we build a bridge to the future or a bridge to the past; about whether we believe our best days are still out there or our best days are behind us; about whether we want a country of people all working together or one where you're on your own, end quote. Are you saying that you believe Senator Dole is a man of the past and if elected president he would lead the country backward?CLINTON: Well, I'm saying that Senator Dole said in his fine speech in San Diego that he wanted to build a bridge to the past. And I think I know what he meant by that. He's troubled, as I am, by some of the things that go on today. But I believe America is the greatest country in human history because we have maintained freedom and increasing prosperity by relentlessly pushing the barriers of knowledge, the barriers of the present, always moving into the future. That's why when I became President I was determined to kind of move beyond this whole stale debate that had gone on in Washington for too long to get this country moving again. And that's why we've got a country with ten and a half million more jobs, and record numbers of new businesses, and rising incomes, and falling crime rates, and welfare roll rates. That's why we're moving in the right direction. And I'm trying to emphasize that what I want to do is to continue to do that. That's why my balanced budget plan will still invest and grow this economy. That's why I want a tax cut for education and child rearing, but it's got to be paid for. That's why I want to continue the work we have done over partisan opposition, to work with communities to bring that crime rate down until our streets are all safe again. These are my commitments. I am very oriented toward the future. I think this election has to be geared toward the future. I think America's best days are still ahead, but we've got to build the right bridge.LEHRER: Senator Dole.DOLE: You know, the President reminds me sometimes of my brother Kenny, who is no longer alive. But Kenny was a great talker. And he used to tell me things that I knew were not quite accurate. So we always had a rule, we divided by six. Maybe in your case maybe just two. But 11 million new jobs and everything, I mean the President can't take credit for everything that governors are doing, whether that's happening in New York City when it comes to the murder rate and then not be responsible for the bad things that happen, whether it's drug use or something else in America. So it seems to me that we can talk about what we call Kenny, the great exaggerator. He just liked to make it sound exager, a little better, made him feel better.When it comes to bridges, I want a bridge to the future. I also want a bridge to the truth. We have to tell the truth. We've got people watching tonight and listening tonight trying to find the truth. And the truth is, there is a lot wrong with America. We need a strong economic package; we need a tax cut; we need the $500 child credit, and we'll have that soon.LEHRER: Mr. President.CLINTON: I do not for a moment think I'm entitled to all the credit for all the good things that have happened in America. But where I have moved to work with the American people to help them have the tools to make the most of their own lives, I think I should get some credit for that.I also personally took responsibility tonight when Senator Dole asked me about the drug problem. But, you know, I think my ideas are better for the future.Senator Dole voted against student loans, against Headstart, against creating the Department of Education. If he gets elected president, we'll start the new century without anyone in the cabinet of the President representing education in our children. I personally don't think that's the right kind of future for America, and I think we ought to take a different tack.LEHRER: Senator Dole, do you still favor eliminating the Department of Education.DOLE: Yes. I didn't favor it when it was in, started. I voted against it. It was a tribute after President Carter's election to the National Education Association who send a lot of delegates to the Democratic convention, who gives 99.5 percent of their money, Democrat Democrats, and the President, and a lot of the teachers send their kids to private schools or better public schools. So what we want to do is called opportunity scholarships. Now, some say, oh, you're a Republican, you can't be reaching out to these people. I've reached out to people all my life. I've worked on the food stamp program, proudly. And the WIC program, and the school lunch program with senators like George McGovern, Hubert Humphrey and others, to name a few of my Democratic friends.I'm not some extremist out here. I care about people. I have my own little foundation that's raised about $10 million for the disabled. I don't advertise it. Just did, haven't before. And I try to do a lot of things that I think might be helpful to people.So it seems to me that we ought to take that money we can save from the Department of Education, put it into opportunity scholarships and tell little Landale Shakespeare out in Cleveland, Ohio, and tell your mother and father, you're going to get to go to school because we're going to match what the state puts up, and you're going to go to the school of your choice. I don't fault the President or the vice president for sending their children to private schools or better schools. I applaud them for it, I don't criticize them. But why shouldn't everybody have that choice. Why shouldn't low income Americans and low middle income Americans. I'm excited about it. It's going to be a big, big opportunity for a lot of people.CLINTON: Let me say first of all, I'm all for students having more choices. We've worked hard to expand public school choice in my balanced budget bill. There's funds for 3,000 new schools created by teachers and parents, sometimes by business people, called charter schools that have no rules, they're free of bureaucracy and can only stay in existence if they perform and teach children. The ones that are out there are doing well.What I'm against is Senator Dole's plan to take money away from all the children we now help with limited Federal funds and help far fewer. If we're going to have a private voucher plan, that ought to be done at the local level or the state level. But Senator Dole has consistently opposed Federal help to education. He voted against student loans; he voted against my improved student loan plan; he voted against the National Service bill, against the HeadStart bill; he voted against our efforts in safe and drug-free schools. He voted against these programs, he does not believe it. That's the issue. 90 percent of our kids are out there in those public schools and we need to lift their standards and move them forward with the programs like those I've outlined in this campaign.DOLE: I'd better correct the President. I don't know what time it is, but it's probably getting late. I want to correct, the all these things I voted against, they were probably part of some big package that had a lot of pork in it or a lot of things that we shouldn't have had and we probably voted no. I've supported all the education programs. I've supported Headstart, I think we ought to look at it. So I don't want anybody out there to think we've just been voting no, no, no. Let's give low income parents the same right that people of power and prestige have in America and let them go to better schools. Let's not, let's help, let's turn the schools back to the teachers and back to the parents and take it away from the National Education Association.LEHRER: Mr. President, what is wrong with the school choice proposal?CLINTON: I support school choice. I support school choice. I have advocated expansions of public school choice alternatives and I said the creation of 3,000 new schools that we are going to help the states to finance. But if you're going to have a private voucher plan, that ought to be determined by states in localities where they're raising and spending most of the money.I simply think it's wrong to take money away from programs that are helping build basic skills for kids, 90 percent of them are in the public schools; to take money away from programs that are helping fund the school lunch program, that are helping to fund the other programs, that are helping our schools to improve their standards. Our schools are getting better, and our schools can be made to be even better still with the right kind of community leadership and partnership at the school level.I have been a strong force for reform. And, Senator, I remind you that a few years ago when I supported teacher testing while in my home state I was pretty well lambasted by the teachers association. I just don't believe we ought to be out there running down teachers and attacking them the way you did at the Republican convention. I think we ought to be lifting them up and moving our children forward.And let me just say that budget that you passed that I vetoed would have cut 50,000 kids out of Headstart. It would have eliminated the AmeriCorps plan and it would have cut back on student loans and scholarships. Now, it would have. That's a fact. That's one of the big reasons I vetoed it. We need to be doing more in education, not less.DOLE: Well, the AmeriCorps program, I must say, if that's one of your successes, I wouldn't speak about it too loudly. It costs about $27,000 to pay people to volunteer. We've got four million young people volunteering every year, the number hasn't gone down. And you pick out 20,000, whether they need the money or not, and they get paid for volunteering. I like young people. I like teachers. I'm a product of a public school. You attended a private school for some time in your life. I like teachers. You're not for school choice, you can't be for school choice, because this is that special interest money again. When you get 99.5 percent of the money, we don't know what happened to the other .5 percent, we're looking for it, somebody got it, but it all went to Democrats. And this is part of that liberal establishment, one of those liberal things that you just can't do. You're for school uniforms and curfews and you're opposed to truancy. Now that's not reform, Mr. President. Why can't Landale Shakespeare in Cleveland or Pilar Gonzales in Milwaukee give their children an opportunity to go to a better school. Some schools aren't safe. Some schools aren't even safe. Your choice is nothing. Let's give them a real choice, the kind of choice you had, and the kind of choice a lot of people have in America. If we want to stop crime and teenage pregnancy, let's start with education.CLINTON: First of all, Senator Dole, let's set the record straight. I was able for two years when I was in, a very young boy to go to a Catholic school, but I basically went to public schools all my life. And I've worked hard for a long time to make them better, 90 percent of our kids are there. You, it's amazing to me, you are all for having more responsibility at the local level for everything except schools. Where we don't have very much money at the Federal level to spend on education, we ought to spend it helping the 90 percent of the kids that we can help. If a local school district in Cleveland or anyplace else wants to have a private choice plan like Milwaukee did, let them have at it. I might say the results are highly ambiguous. But I want to get out there and give a better education opportunity to all of our children and that's why I vetoed the budget you passed with $30 billion in education cuts. It was wrong, and my plan for the future is better.LEHRER: Senator Dole, at the Republican convention you said the following and I quote, it is demeaning to the nation that within the Clinton Administration a core of the elite who never grew up, never did anything real, never sacrificed, never suffered, and never learned should have the power to fund with your earnings their dubious and self-serving schemes, end quote. Whom precisely and what precisely did you have in mind?DOLE: I had precisely in mind a lot of the people that were in the White House and other agencies who've never been had any experience, who came to Washington without any experience, they all were very liberal, of course, or they wouldn't be in the administration. And their idea was that they knew what was best for the American people.Now, I feel very strongly about a lot of things. I feel strongly about education. I want to help young people have an education, just as I had an education after World War II with the GI bill of Rights. We've had millions of young men and women in subsequent subsequent wars change the face of the nation because the government helped with their education.Now the reason they don't have, The reason the President can't support this is pretty obvious. It's not taking anything away from schools, it's new money. It's not being taken away from anybody else, except we'll downsize the Department of Education. But this is a very liberal administration. This is an administration that gave you the big tax cut. This administration tried to take over healthcare and impose a governmental system. This is the administration that fought regulatory reform that is putting a lot of small businessmen and small businesswomen out of business. This is the administration that fought the balanced budget amendment and vetoed a balanced budget and vetoed welfare reform twice, and the list goes on and on and on, that's what I had in mind.I want people in my administration and will have people in my administration who understand America. There won't be 10 millionaires and 14 lawyers in the cabinet. There will be people with experience and people who understand America and people who've made it and know the hard knocks in life.CLINTON: When Senator Dole made that remark about all the elitists, all the young elitists in the administration, one of the young men who works for me who grew up in a house trailer looked at me and said, Mr. President, I know how you grew up, who is he talking about. And you know this liberal charge, that's what their party always drags out when they get in a tight race. It's sort of their golden oldie, you know. It's a record they think they can play that everybody loves to hear. And I just don't think that dog will hunt this time.The American people should make up their own mind. Here's the record: We cut deficit four years in a row for the first time before the Civil War -- I mean, before World War II, and maybe before the Civil War, too. We've got ten and a half million new jobs; we've got record numbers of those new small businesses. We've made every one of them eligible for a tax cut. We've got declining crime rates, two million fewer people on welfare rolls before welfare reform passed, and a 50 percent increase in child support and a crime bill with 60 death penalties and 100,000 police and the assault weapons ban. The American people can make up their mind about whether that's a liberal record or a record that's good for America. Liberal, conservative, you put whatever label you want on it.DOLE: Well, I think it's pretty liberal, I'll put that label on it. You take a look at all the programs you've advocated, Mr. President. Thank goodness we had a Republican Congress there. The first thing you did when you came into office was set up the stimulus package, said we've got a little pork we want to scatter around America, $16 billion. And even some in your own party couldn't buy that.I remember talking by the telephone. I'm not even certain you were too excited about that. I won't, I never repeat what I've talked to the President about. In any event, we saved the taxpayers $16 billion. And then came some other program, and then came healthcare, and then came the tax increase and a lot of these things stopped in 1994 because then the Congress changed, and I think we've done a good job.LEHRER: Mr. President, if you're not a liberal, describe your political philosophy.CLINTON: I believe that the purpose of politics is to give people the tools to make the most of their own lives; to reinforce the values of opportunity and responsibility, and to build a sense of community so we're all working together. I don't believe in discrimination. I believe you can protect the environment and grow the economy. I believe that we have to do these things with a government that's smaller and less bureaucratic, but that we have to do them nonetheless.It's inconvenient for Senator Dole, but the truth is I've reduced the size of government more than my Republican predecessors. And I did stop them, I admit that. I sure stopped their budget. Their budget cut enforcement for the Environmental Protection Agency by a third. It cut funds to clean up toxic waste dumps with 10 million of our kids still living within four miles of a toxic waste dump, by a third. It ended the principle that the polluters should pay for those toxic waste dumps unless it was very recent. Their budget weakened our support for education. $30 billion, even cut funds for scholarships and college loans. Their budget cut $270 billion in Medicare and, finally, their budget withdrew the national guarantee of healthcare to poor children, families with children with handicaps, the elderly in nursing homes, poor pregnant women. It was wrong for the country and calling it conservative won't make it right. It was a bad decision for America and would have been bad for our future if I hadn't stopped it.DOLE: Well, the President can define himself in any way he wants, but I think we have to look at the record. Go back to the time he was, what, Texas director for George McGovern. George McGovern is a friend of mine, so I don't mean, but he was a liberal, proud liberal. I've just finished reading a book, I think it's called -- what is it called, what is it, The Demise of the Democratic Party by Ronald Cardash (ph) or something talking about all the liberal influences in the administration. Whether it's organized labor or whether it's the Hollywood elite or whether some of the media elite or whether it's the labor unions or whatever. And so I think you take a look at it. The bottom line is this: I think the American people, thought he'd recite all these bills and all these things, they want to know what's going to happen to them. They've all got a lot of anxieties out there. Did anybody complain when you raised taxes? Did anybody go out and ask the people, how are you going to pay the extra money? That's why we want an economic package. We want the government to pinch their pennies for a change instead of the people pinching their pennies. That's what our message is to the people watching. Not all this back and forth, you voted this way, you voted that way, we want a better America as we go into the next century.CLINTON: The way you get a better America is to balance the budget and protect Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment; to give a targeted tax cut -- and let me talk about the education tax cut -- to let people have a $10,000 deduction for the cost of college tuition in any year, any kind of college tuition; to give families a tax credit, a dollar for dollar reduction in their taxes for the cost of a typical community college so we can open that to everybody. And then to let people save in an IRA and withdraw from it without a tax penalty for education, home buying or medical expenses, that's the right way to go into the 21st Century, balance the budget and cut taxes, not balloon with this $550 billion tax scheme.LEHRER: Senator Dole, we've talked mostly now about differences between the two of you that relate to policy issues and that sort of thing. Are there also significant differences in the more personal area that are relevant to this election?DOLE: Let me say first, on the President's promise for another tax cut. I mean, I've told people as I've traveled around, all of you that got the tax cut he promised last time, vote for him in '96 and not many hands go up. So the question is, would you buy a used election promise from my opponent. The people want economic reform. They're having a hard time making ends meet. You've got one parent working for the government, the other parent working for the family. This is important business. This is about getting the economy moving again. This is about American jobs and opportunities. It's about the government, as I said before, pinching its pennies for a change instead of the poor taxpayer. When they raise your taxes nobody runs around asking people where are you going to get the extra money. I think the government can do better. Are there personal differences?LEHRER: That are relevant to this.DOLE: Well, my blood pressure is lower, my weight, my cholesterol, but I will not make health an issue in this campaign. So I think he's a bit taller than I am. But I think there are personal differences. I mean, I'm not I don't like to get into personal matters. As far as I'm concerned, this is a campaign about issues. It's about my vision for America and about his liberal vision for America. And not about personal things. You know, I think his liberal vision is a thing of the past. I know he wants to disown it. I wouldn't want to be a liberal either, Mr. President, but you're stuck with it because that's your record, that's your record in Arkansas: The biggest tax increase in history. The biggest crime increase in history, the biggest drug increase in history in Arkansas.LEHRER: Mr. President.CLINTON: Well, just for the record, when I was governor we had the lowest -- second lowest tax burden of any state in the country, the highest job growth rate of any state when I ran for president and were widely recognized for a lot of other advances.But the important thing is, what are we going to do now. I think a targeted tax cut is better for our future, targeted to education and child rearing, with the rest of the education plan, hooking up all of our classrooms to the Internet by the year 2000. Making sure we've got an army of reading volunteers, trained people to teach with parents and teachers so that our eight year olds can learn to read. Investing in our environment. Cleaning up two-thirds of the worst toxic waste dumps. Those plans are better than this $550 billion tax scheme.Now, remember, folks, even Senator Dole's campaign co-chair here, Senator D'Amato, says he's got to cut Medicare to pay for this. Everybody who's looked at it, 500 economists, seven Nobel prize winners, say it's bad for the economy. It's going to blow a hole in the deficit It's going to raise taxes on nine million people and require bigger cuts than the one I vetoed. Our plan is better, it will take us into the future with a growing economy and healthier families.DOLE: Well, I'm really encouraged to know of your renewed friendship with Al D'Amato, and I know he appreciates it. You didn't even have tax cuts in your budget, Mr. President, the first two years you were president. It wasn't until we had a Republican Congress you even thought about, you talked about tax cuts. Getting back to personal differences, I think, Jim, if you are a little more specific, but I think the President could clarify one thing tonight and that's the question of pardons. I know you talked about it on the Jim, with Jim Lehrer on the PBS show. And I've never discussed Whitewater, as I've told you personally. I'm not discussing Whitewater now. But I am discussing the power the President has to grant pardons. And hopefully in the next segment you could lay that to rest.LEHRER: Mr. President.CLINTON: Well, first of all, you know, he made that remark about Senator D'Amato. He's arranged for me to spend a lot more time with Senator D'Amato in the last couple years so I'm more familiar with his comments than I used to be. Let me say what I've said already about this pardon issue. This is an issue they've brought up. It's under, there's been no consideration of it, no discussion of it. I will tell you this: I will not give anyone special treatment and I will strictly adhere to the law. And that is what every president has done, as far as I know, in the past but what every other president's has done. This is something I take seriously and that's my position.DOLE: But it seems to me the president shouldn't have any comment at all. Particularly where it's someone where you've had business dealings. I mean, you may be sending a signal. I don't know, I'm not questioning anybody.But as a President of the United States, when somebody asks you about pardons, you say no comment, period. And I think he made a mistake. And I think when you make a mistake, you say I made a mistake. But apparently his position hasn't changed. If there are other specific areas, but beyond that I haven't gotten into any of these things, as the President knows. We've had that discussion. And again I know Senator D'Amato I think may have had a hearing or two on Whitewater, I can't remember, but he's not my general chairman, he's a friend of mine. And so is Senator Kennedy a friend of yours.CLINTON: You bet.DOLE: I remember one day on the floor I said now, gentlemen, let me tax your memories, and Kennedy jumped up and said, why haven't we thought of that before. You know, so one of your liberal friends.CLINTON: Thank you.LEHRER: Mr. President, 30 seconds.CLINTON: No comment.DOLE: What's the subject matter?LEHRER: Senator Dole, if you could single out one thing that you would like for the voters to have in their mind about President Clinton on a policy matter or a personal matter, what would it be? Something to know about him, understand it and appreciate it.DOLE: See, if I say anything it's going to be misconstrued. I don't think there is even a race between the two, it's about our vision for America.I happen to like President Clinton personally. I'm addressing him all evening as Mr. President. I said in 1992 he didn't extend that courtesy to President Bush. But I respect the presidency. I've served under a number of presidents. They all have their strengths and they all have their weaknesses. So I'd rather talk about my strengths. And I think I have my strengths and I think the best thing going for Bob Dole is that Bob Dole keeps his word. It's a question between trust and fear, and I would say, I think, Mr. President, about all you've got going in this campaign is fear.You're spending millions and millions of dollars in negative ads frightening senior citizens. I know this to be a fact because I had one tell me last week, Senator don't cut my Medicare. I'm trying to save your Medicare, just as I rescued Social Security with a bipartisan commission. I have relatives on Medicare. I used to sign welfare checks for my grandparents. I know all about poverty and all about need and all about taking care of people, and that's been my career in the United States Senate.And I'll keep my word on the economic package. If I couldn't cut taxes and balance the budget the same time, I wouldn't look at you in the eye in your living room or wherever you might be and say that this is good for America. People will tell you who served with Bob Dole, agree or disagree, he kept his word. That's what this race is all about.CLINTON: I'd like the American people to know that I have worked very hard to be on their side. And to move this country forward and we're better off than we were four years ago. But the most important thing is my plan for the 21st Century is a better plan. A targeted tax cut, a real commitment to educational reform. A deep commitment to making welfare reform work with incentives to the private sector to move people from welfare to work. Now we have to create those jobs, now that we're requiring people to go do work.A commitment to continuing step-by-step healthcare reform with the next step helping people who are between jobs to access healthcare and not lose it just because they are out of work for a while. A commitment to grow the economy while protecting the environment. That's what I'd like them to know about me; that I've gotten up every day and worked for the American people and worked so that their children could have their dreams come true.And I believe we've got the results to show we're on the right track. The most important thing is, I believe we've got the right ideas for the future. And I like, I like Senator Dole, you can probably tell we like each other. We just see the world in different ways. And you folks out there are going to have to choose who you think is right.DOLE: Well, I'd say the first homeless bill in the Senate was the Dole-Byrd Byrd-Dole bill, I can't remember who was in control then. I remember working with Senator Ribicoff from Connecticut on the Hospice program. We now have 2500 hospices. As I said, I've worked all my life when I was in the Congress. I left on June 11th because I wanted the American people to know that I was willing to give up something.President Clinton ran for governor in 1990 and said he's going to fill out his term, but he didn't. He's president so I guess it's a little better deal. But I wanted the American people to know I was willing to give up something. I wasn't just getting more power and more power. So I rolled the dice, I put my career on the line because I really believe the future of America is on the line.We can give you all these numbers, they don't mean a thing. If you are out of work, you have nothing to eat or you can't have medical care, or you're holding a crack baby in your arms right now, what do you do next? You know, America's best days are ahead of us. I've seen the tough times, I know they can be better and I'll lead America to a brighter future.LEHRER: Mr. President, what do you say to Senator Dole's point that this election is about keeping one's word?CLINTON: Let's look at that. When I ran for president, I said we'd cut the deficit in half in four years; we cut it by 60 percent. I said that our economic plan would produce eight million jobs, we have ten and a half million new jobs. We're number one in autos again, record numbers of new small businesses. I said we'd put, pass a crime bill that would put 100,000 police on the street, ban assault weapons, and deal with the problems that ought to be dealt with with capital punishment, including capital punishment for drug kingpins, and we did that.I said we would change the way welfare works, and even before the bill passed we'd moved nearly two million people from welfare to work, working with states and communities. I said we'd get tougher with child support and child support enforcement's up 50 percent. I said that I would work for tax relief for middle class Americans. The deficit was bigger than I thought it was going to be. I think they're better off, all of us are, that we got the interest rates down and the deficit down.Republicans talk about it, but we're the first the first administration in anybody's lifetime looking at this program to bring that deficit down four years in a row. We still gave tax cuts to 15 million working Americans, and now I've got a plan that's been out there for two years, it could have been passed already, but instead the Republicans shut the government down to try to force their budget and their plan on me, and I couldn't take that. But we'll get the rest of that tax relief. And so I think when you look at those results, you know the plan I've laid out for the future has a very good chance of being enacted if you'll give me a chance to build that bridge to the 21st Century.LEHRER: Senator.DOLE: Well, there he goes again, that line has been used before, I mean, exaggerating all the things that he did. He didn't do all these things. Let's take all these four years in a row. He came in with a high growth rate, the 1990 budget agreement, which some, you know, didn't like, had some very tough cost controls, put a lot of pressure on Congress. The S &amp; L crisis was over, they're starting to sell assets, all that money was coming in. And he cut defense an extra $60 billion, threw a lot of people out of work.He talks about a smaller government. There are actually more people in government except for people in defense related jobs. They're gone. The government's bigger than it was when President Kennedy was around, even though he says it's not. In addition, Republican Congress cut $53 billion. So let's just, let's give credit where credit is due. Governor Engler of Michigan cut taxes 21 times, created a lot of new jobs. So did Governor Thompson, so did Governor Rowland. A lot of people ought to deserve credit, Mr. President. When I'm President of the United States we're going to have a governors' council and we're going to work directly with the governors to get power back to the people and back to the states.CLINTON: I think a lot of people deserve credit and I've tried to give it to them. But I believe that my plan is better than Senator Dole's ill-advised $550 billion scheme which I'll say again will blow a hole in the deficit. Our plan will balance the budget, grow the economy, preserve the environment, and invest in education. We have the right approach for the future and looks at the results. It is not midnight in America, Senator. We are better off than we were four years ago.LEHRER: All right. That's the last question, the last answer. Let's go now to the closing statements. Mr. President, you're first. Two minutes.CLINTON: Well, first, Jim, let me thank you and thank you, Senator Dole, and thank you, ladies and gentlemen, all of you listening tonight for the chance you've given us to appear.I want to say in the beginning that I am profoundly grateful for the chance that you have given me to serve as president for the last four years. I never could have dreamed anything like this would come my way in life, and I've done my best to be faithful to the charge you've given me.I'm proud of the fact that America is stronger and more prosperous and more secure than we were four years ago. And I'm glad we're going in the right direction. And I've done my best tonight to lay out my plans for going forward to an even better future in the next century. I'd like to leave you with the thought that the things I do as president are basically driven by the people whose lives I have seen affected by what does or doesn't happen in this country. The auto worker in Toledo who was unemployed when I was elected and now has a great job because we're number one in auto production again. All the people I've met who used to be on welfare who are now working and raising their children. And I think what others could do for our country and themselves if we did the welfare reform thing in the proper way. I think of the man who grabbed me by the shoulder once with tears in his eyes and said his daughter was dying of cancer and he thanked me for giving him a chance to spend some time with her without losing his job because of the Family and Medical Leave Act. I think of all the people I grew up with and went to school with and who I stay in touch with and who nerve let me forget how what we do in Washington affects all of you out there in America. Folks, we can build that bridge to the 21st Century, big enough and strong enough for all of us to walk across, and I hope you will help me build it.LEHRER: Senator Dole, your closing statement, sir.DOLE: Thank you, Jim; thank you, Mr. President; thank everyone for watching and listening.I want to address my remarks to the young people of America, because they're the ones that are going to spend most of their life in the 21st Century. They're the ones who have the challenges and they are people out there making predictions that it's not going to be the same. You're not going to have the opportunities; there are going to be more deficits, more drugs, more crime, and less confidence in the American people. And that's what you're faced with, the parents are faced with, and the grand parents are faced with. It's important, it's their future. And I would say to those I know there are more young people experimenting with drugs today than ever before; drug use has gone up. And if you care about the future of America, if you care about your future, just don't do it. And I know that I'm someone older than you. But I've had my anxious moments in my life. I've learned to feed myself and to walk and to dress. I'm standing here as proof that in America the possibilities are unlimited. I know who I am, and I know where I'm from, and I know where I want to take America. We are the greatest country on the face of the earth. We do more good things for more people in our communities, our neighborhoods, than anywhere that I know of. This is important business. This election is important. I ask for your support, I ask for your help. And if you really want to get involved, just tap into my home page, www.DoleKemp96.org. Thank you. God bless America.Transcription by: AM Court Reporting, White Plains, NY. Conlin, A. O'Donnell, A. Sikora, K. Jones, D. Hughes, J. Tepper, K. Ortilano, J. Spinozzi (staff).\",\n",
       " 'September 25, 1988 Debate TranscriptSeptember 25, 1988The First Bush-Dukakis Presidential DebateLEHRER: Good evening. On behalf of the Commission on Presidential Debates I am pleased to welcome you to this first presidential debate of the 1988 campaign. I\\'m Jim Lehrer of the McNeil-Lehrer News Hour. My colleagues on the panel are John Mashek of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution; Ann Groer of The Orlando Sentinel; and Peter Jennings of ABC News. For the next 90 minutes we will be questioning the candidates for president of the United States following a format designed and agreed to by representatives of the two candidates. The candidates are Vice President George Bush, the Republican nominee; Governor Michael Dukakis, the Democratic nominee.(Applause)LEHRER: Our questions this evening will be about equally divided between foreign and domestic policy matters. The first question by agreement between the two candidates goes to Vice President Bush. It is a domestic question. You have two minutes for an answer, sir. The polls say the number one domestic issue to a majority of voters is drugs. What is there about these times that drives or draws so many Americans to use drugs?BUSH: I think we\\'ve seen a deterioration of values. I think for a while as a nation we condoned those things we should have condemned. For a while, as I recall, it even seems to me that there was talk of legalizing or decriminalizing marijuana and other drugs, and I think that\\'s all wrong. So we\\'ve seen a deterioration in values, and one of the things that I think we should do about it in terms of cause is to instill values into the young people in our schools. We got away, we got into this feeling that value- free education was the thing. And I don\\'t believe that at all I do believe there are fundamental rights and wrongs as far as use. And, of course, as far as the how we make it better, yes, we can do better on interdiction. But we\\'ve got to do a lot better on education, and we have to do, be tougher on those who commit crimes. We\\'ve got to get after the users more. We have to change this whole culture. You know, I saw a movie - \"Crocodile Dundee.\" And I saw the cocaine scene treated with humor, as though this was a humorous little incident. And it\\'s bad. Everybody ought to be in this thing. Entertainment industry, people involved in the schools, education. And it isn\\'t a Republican or a Democrat or a liberal problem. But we have got to instill values in these young people. And I have put forward a many-point drug program that includes what I would do as president of the United States; in terms of doing better on interdiction; and in terms of better in the neighborhoods. But I think we\\'re all in this together, and my plea to the American people is values in the schools.LEHRER: Governor, you have one minute to respond.DUKAKIS: I agree with Mr. Bush that values are important. But it\\'s important that our leaders demonstrate those values from the top. That means those of us who are elected to positions of political leadership have to reflect those values ourselves. Here we are with a government that\\'s been dealing with a drug-running Panamanian dictator. We\\'ve been dealing with him; he\\'s been dealing drugs to our kids. Governors like me and others have been trying to deal with the consequences. I remember being in a high school in my own state as we were organizing something we call the Governor\\'s Alliance Against Drugs, and a young 16 year old girl coming up to me, desperate, addicted, dependent, saying, Governor, I need help. We\\'re providing that young woman with help. But I want to be a president of the United States who makes sure that we never again do business with a drug-running Panamanian dictator, that we never again funnel aid to the contras through convicted drug dealers. Values begin at the top, in the White House. Those are the values I want to bring to the presidency and to the White House beginning in January of 1989.LEHRER: Governor, a follow-up question. You have two minutes to answer it. Are you suggesting, sir, that President Reagan is one of the causes of the drug problem in this country?DUKAKIS: I\\'m saying that those of us who are elected to positions of political leadership, Jim, have a special responsibility, not only to come up with programs, and I have outlined in detail the very important, very strong program of enforcement as well as drug education prevention. And Mr. Bush is right - the two go hand in hand. But if our government itself is doing business with people who we know are engaged in drug profiteering and drug trafficking, if we don\\'t understand that that sends out a very, very bad message to our young people, it\\'s a little difficult for me to understand just how we can reach out to that youngster that I talked about and to young people like her all over the country, and say to them we want to help you. Now, I\\'ve outlined in great detail a program for being tough on enforcement at home and abroad, doubling the number of drug enforcement agents, having a hemispheric summit soon after the 20th of January when we bring our democratic neighbors and allies together here in this hemisphere and go to work together. But we also have to take demand seriously. You know, we have five percent of the world\\'s population in this country. We\\'re consuming 50 percent of the world\\'s cocaine. Doing better in the neighborhoods. But I think we\\'re all in this together, and my plea to the American people is values in the schools.LEHRER: Governor, you have one minute to respond.DUKAKIS: I agree with Mr. Bush that values are important. But it\\'s important that our leaders demonstrate those values from the top. That means those of us who are elected to positions of political leadership have to reflect those values ourselves. Here we are with a government that\\'s been dealing with a drug-running Panamanian dictator. We\\'ve been dealing with him; he\\'s been dealing drugs to our kids.

But we also have to take demand seriously. You know, we have five percent of the world\\'s population in this country. We\\'re consuming 50 percent of the world\\'s cocaine. And in my state I\\'m proud to say we\\'ve organized a drug education and prevention program which the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration says is a model for the country. We\\'re helping youngsters; we\\'re reaching out to them. And we\\'re beginning with drug education and prevention beginning in the early elementary grades in every elementary school in our state, and that\\'s the kind of effort we need in every elementary school in the United States of America. And we\\'ve got to begin early, in the first, second and third grade, before our youngsters begin to experiment with these very, very dangerous substances. I guess the question I would ask of Mr. Bush is how we instill those values, how we create this environment for the drug free schools that we want in this country. If he or representatives of the administration are either with or involving people like Noriega in our foreign policy, or don\\'t pursue that connection in a way that makes it possible for us to cut it off and to be an example to our kids all over the country.LEHRER: A minute to rebut, Mr. Vice President.BUSH: Well, the other day my opponent was given a briefing by the CIA. I asked for and received the same briefing. I am very careful in public life about dealing with classified information. And what I\\'m about to say is unclassified. Seven administrations were dealing with Mr. Noriega. It was the Reagan-Bush administration that brought this man to justice. And as the governor of Massachusetts knows, there was no evidence that governor - that Mr. Noriega was involved in drugs, no hard evidence until we indicted him. And so I think it\\'s about time we get this Noriega matter in perspective. Panama is a friendly country. I went down there and talked to the president of Panama about cleaning up their money laundering, and Mr. Noriega was there, but there was no evidence at that time, and when the evidence was there, we indicted him. And we want to bring him to justice. And so call off all those pickets out there that are trying to tear down seven different administrations.LEHRER: All right, the next question will be asked by John Mashek. It goes to Governor Dukakis, and you\\'ll have two minutes to answer.MASHEK: Governor Dukakis, another troublesome issue for voters this year is the bulging federal deficit. In a Dukakis administration, you say taxes will be raised only as a last resort. Would you identify for us then please three specific programs that you are willing to cut to bring that deficit down?DUKAKIS: Yes, I\\'ve been very specific about those, John. And let me lay out for you my own strategy for bring that deficit down, because as a chief executive that\\'s balanced ten budgets in a row, I\\'ve had to make those tough decisions and those tough choices. First, I\\'ve suggested that there are certain weapons systems which we don\\'t need and we can\\'t afford. Mr. Bush has been critical of me for that, but I think those are the kinds of tough choices you have to make. I\\'ve also suggested that there are weapons systems that we should proceed on, and I\\'ve outlined those in detail. Secondly, we\\'ve got to invest in economic growth in this country, in every part of this country. Building that kind of growth expands revenues and helps to bring down that deficit. Thirdly, we have to bring interest rates down, and we will as we come up with a good, solid plan with the Congress for bringing that deficit down. And, finally, we\\'ve got to go out there and collect billions and billions of dollars in taxes owed that aren\\'t being paid to this country. It\\'s very unfair to the average taxpayer who pays his taxes and pays them on time to permit these monies to go uncollected. I\\'ve also suggested that on the domestic side there are areas where we can make some cuts. We ought to be able to come up with an agricultural policy in this country that gives our farm families a fair price and a decent future without spending $20-25 billion a year, which is what we\\'ve been doing under this administration. We can help people to live better lives, and at the same time save money by helping hundreds of thousands of families on welfare to get off or welfare, and to become productive citizens again. The thing I don\\'t understand about Mr. Bush\\'s approach to this is how he could possibly be serious about bringing that deficit down given what he says he wants to do. He seems to want to spend a great deal of money on just about every weapon system; he says he\\'s against new taxes, although he\\'s broken that pledge at least times in the last year that I know of; he wants to give the wealthiest taxpayers in this country a five year, $40 billion tax break. He also wants to spend a lot of money on additional programs. If he keeps this up, he\\'s going to be the Joe Isuzu of American politics.(Laughter)DUKAKIS: But I hope you won\\'t take my five seconds away from me. I will say this -LEHRER: Your two minutes is up, Governor.DUKAKIS: If he\\'s serious about what he\\'s saying, then the only place he can go to balance that budget is to raid the Social Security Trust Fund, and he tried that in 1985, and I think he\\'s going to try it again.LEHRER: You have a minute to rebut.BUSH: Is this the time to unleash our one-liners? That answer was about as clear as Boston harbor.(Laughter)BUSH: Let me help the governor. There are so many things there, I don\\'t quite know where to begin. When you cut capital gains, you put people to work. John Kennedy proposed cutting capital gains. Paul Tsongas, a liberal senator from Massachusetts said the dumbest thing I did was to oppose the capital gains cut. It\\'s not going to cost the government money. It\\'s going to increase revenues to the federal government, and it\\'s going to create jobs. So that\\'s one of the things that I think makes a big difference between us. Massachusetts doesn\\'t have an enormous defense budget, but nevertheless, the governor raised taxes five different times. That happens to be a fact. And so let\\'s kind of stay on the issue, and I have made a specific proposal for what I call a flexible freeze. And it permits - economists on the East Coast and West think it\\'s good - it permits the president to sort out the priorities, and we continue to grow because I will not raise taxes.LEHRER: Your time is up, too. A follow-up, John.MASHEK: Mr. Vice President, you have vowed not to raise taxes of any kind during your administration and at the same time you\\'ve proposed this capital gains cut, you\\'ve proposed more incentive breaks for the oil industry. You\\'ve suggested new spending programs and even some Republicans say the flexible freeze you just spoke about will hardly make a dent in the deficit. Is the deficit no longer really a concern of yours, the Republican Party or the taxpayers?BUSH: I think it\\'s the Republican Party and my concern to bring it down. And presidential leadership that I want to provide in this area will bring it down, but we\\'ve got to get the Democrats - Congress under control. They do all the spending, they appropriate every dime and tell us how to spend every dime. I\\'d like to ask the Governor to join in getting for the president what 43 governors have, the line-item veto. He has to operate in Massachusetts under a balanced budget proviso. I would like a balanced budget amendment. But the dynamics of the economy - we cut the taxes and revenues are up by 25 percent in three years. So the problem is - it\\'s not that the working is being taxed too little or the person working out - the woman working in some factory being taxed too little. It is that we are continuing to spend too much. So, my formula says grow at the rate of inflation. Permit the president to set the priorities on where we do the spending. And remember the Federal deficit has come down $70 billion in one year, in 1987. And if we - and the - actually this year Congress is doing a little better in controlling the growth of spending. Spending was only up something like 4 percent. So, it isn\\'t that we\\'re taking too little - from taxpayer - we\\'re spending too much still. And the formula I\\'ve given you works, we\\'ve put it through a good economic model, we\\'ve got good economists on the West Coast, Michael Boskin and Marty Feldstein up there who\\'s a very respected economist in the - Massachusetts. And they agree, that if we can do what I\\'ve said, we can get it down without going and socking the American taxpayer once again. Capital gains, one more point on that, please let\\'s learn from history. A capital gains differential will increase jobs, increase risk taking, increase revenues to the Federal Government.LEHRER: Governor, you have a minute to rebut.DUKAKIS: Well, I hope all of those Americans out there who are watching us, listening to us and trying to make up their mind about which one of us ought to be president of the United States listen to the Vice President very carefully. What he\\'s proposing after over a trillion in new debt which has been added in the Federal debt in the course of the past eight years, an IOU our children and grandchildren will be paying for years, is a tax cut for the wealthiest one percent of the people in this country, an average of about $30,000 that we\\'re going to give to people making $200,000 a year. Why that\\'s more than the average teacher makes. We\\'ve had enough of that, ladies and gentlemen. We\\'ve run up more debt in the last eight years than under all the presidents from George Washington to Jimmy Carter combined. It\\'s time for a chief executive who can make tough choices, can work with the Congress, can get that deficit down and begin to build a strong fiscal foundation under this country.LEHRER: All right, the next question will be asked by Anne Groer and it will go the Vice President. You have two minutes to answer, sir.GROER: Mr. Vice President, you\\'ve said you want a kinder, gentler presidency, one that helps the less fortunate. Today, 37 million Americans including many working families with aging parents and young children cannot afford any health insurance, but earn too much to qualify for Medicaid. What will you do to provide protection for them and how will you pay for it?BUSH: One thing I will not do is sock every business in the country and, thus, throw some people out of work. I want to keep this economic recovery going. More Americans at work today than any time in history, a greater percentage of the work force. What I will do is permit people to buy into Medicaid. I believe that\\'s the answer. I am proud to have been part of an administration that past the first catastrophic health bill. And in that there are some Medicaid provisions that will be very helpful to the very kind of people we\\'re talking about here. But we\\'ve got to keep going forward without killing off the engine and throwing people out of work. So, the answer lies, it seems to me, in full enforcement of the catastrophic program. It lies to me in flexibility in Medicaid so people at the lowest end can buy in there and get their needs covered and then it also - I do not want to see us mandate across the board that every company has to do this, because I really think that marginal operators are going to go say, \"We can\\'t make it.\" And I think then you\\'re going to see that people are put out of work. All these programs - and this cost on his - is - was - I saw an estimate, I\\'d love to know what he thinks, $35 - $40 billion - and it seems to me that somebody pays that. There isn\\'t any such thing as something free out there. It either gets passed along as increased prices or it gets passed along by people being put out of work so the business can continue to compete. So, I think we ought to do it in the Medicaid system. I think we ought to do it by full enforcement of the catastrophic health insurance. I think we ought to do it by everybody doing what they can do out of conscience. It\\'s a terrible problems in terms of flexibility on private insurance. But I just don\\'t want to mandate it and risk putting this - setting the recovery back.LEHRER: A rebuttal, Governor?DUKAKIS: But, George, that\\'s no answer.BUSH: You don\\'t like the answer, but it\\'s an answer.DUKAKIS: Well, no, it\\'s no answer to those 37 million people, most of them members of working families who don\\'t have a dime of health insurance and don\\'t know how to pay the bills if their kids get sick at night. I was in Houston on Tuesday meeting with a group of good citizens, working citizens. All of them with little or no health insurance. One of them was a father who had been laid off a few months ago and lost his health insurance. Has an 11 year old son and can\\'t let that son compete in sports and Little League, because he\\'s afraid he\\'s going to get hurt and he won\\'t be able to provide health insurance to pay those bills. My state just became the only state in the nation to provide for universal health care and we did it with the support of the business community and labor and the health care community and with virtually everybody in the state. The fact of the matter is that employers who today are insuring their employees are paying the freight, because they\\'re paying for those who aren\\'t. And I think it\\'s time that when you got a job in this country it came with health insurance. That\\'s the way we\\'re going to provide basic health security for all of the citizens of this country of ours.LEHRER: Follow-up, Anne?GROER: Yes. Since your Massachusetts health plan has been attacked by the Vice President and you have defended it in this way, I would like to move on to perhaps one of the most costly medical catastrophes facing Americans today and that is AIDS. In - at the end of September, the thousands of AIDS patients will lose their access to AZT, which is the only Federally approved drug for treatment of the disease. Now, I\\'d like to now, sir, if - what your position is on extending that and what it is you think the government ought to be doing about making AZT and other drugs available to people who are suffering from this disease.DUKAKIS: Well, Anne, let me just say before I answer your question that I didn\\'t know that the Vice President attacked our program in Massachusetts. I hope he hasn\\'t. Because has won the support of a great many people all over the state and I think it\\'s a model for what I hope we can do across the country. But when I proposed my plan this past Tuesday, he or one of his spokesmen called it socialized medicine. The last time the Vice President used that phrase, I suspect he remembers it, don\\'t you? It was in 1964 and that\\'s what he called Medicare. Well, he was wrong then and he\\'s wrong now. (Applause)LEHRER: If I may interrupt at this point and caution the audience as I did before we went on the air, please hold it down. You\\'re only taking time away from your candidate when you do that. Governor, continue, please.DUKAKIS: Let me say this about AIDS. It\\'s the single most important public health crisis, single most important public health emergency we\\'ve had in our lifetimes and I think there are a number of things we have to do including supporting legislation which is now moving through the Congress, which will commit this nation to the resources to find a cure which will provide broad education and prevention, which will provide sensitive and caring treatment for the victims of AIDS. I think we have to demonstrate some flexibility and I think the FDA is attempting to do so now in trying to make it possible for new and experimental drugs to be available to people who are at risk at AIDS and I would hope that we could bring that kind of a policy to bear beginning in January. And I would encourage the current administration to proceed with that kind of flexibility where it\\'s appropriate and where it\\'s done carefully and responsibly. But we have not had the kind of leadership we should have had. In this particular area, I think the Vice President and I are in general agreement on what we have to do. The special Federal commission made good solid recommendations. I think we\\'re both supportive of them and I would strongly lead in that area as I have in my state as Governor.LEHRER: Mr. Vice President, a minute of rebuttal.BUSH: Well, we\\'re on the right track. The NIH is doing a good job in research. The Surgeon General is doing a good job in encouraging the proper kind of education. I notice that the Governor did not mention any testing. But we got to have a knowledge base. Testing should be confidential, but we have to have a knowledge. We can\\'t simply stick our heads in the sands in terms of testing. I\\'m Chairman of the President\\'s Task Force on Regulatory Relief and we are working with the FDA and they have sped up bringing drugs to market that can help. And you got to be careful here, because there\\'s a safety factor, but I think these things - and then also I am one who believes we\\'ve got to go the extra mile in clean - being sure that that blood supply is pure. We cannot have a lack of confidence in the blood supply when it comes to operations and surgery and things of this nature. So, research, speeding the drugs to market, testing, blood supply are very important elements of this.LEHRER: Next question will be asked by Peter Jennings. It goes to the Governor.JENNINGS: Good evening, Mr. Vice President, Governor. Governor, one theme that keeps coming up about the way you govern - you\\'ve both mentioned leadership tonight, so I\\'d like to stay with that for a second. The theme that keeps coming up about the way you govern is passionless, technocratic -DUKAKIS: Passionless?JENNINGS: Passionless, technocratic, the smartest clerk in the world. Your critics maintain that in the 1960\\'s your public passion was not the war in Vietnam or civil rights, but no fault auto insurance. And they say in the 1970\\'s you played virtually no role in the painful busing crisis in Boston. Given the fact that a president must sometimes lead by sheer inspiration and passion. We need to know if this is a fair portrait of your governing or if it is a stereotype. And if it isn\\'t fair, give us an example of where you have had that passion and leadership that sometimes a president needs?LEHRER: Mr. Vice President, a rebuttal.BUSH: Well, I don\\'t question his passion. I question - and I don\\'t question his concern about the war in Vietnam. He introduced or supported legislation back then that suggested that kids of Massachusetts should be exempt from going overseas in that war. Now, that\\'s a certain passion that in my view it\\'s misguided passion. He - we have a big difference on issues. You see, last year in the primary, he expressed his passion. He said, \"I am a strong liberal Democrat\" - August, \\'87. Then he said, \"I am a card-carrying member of the ACLU.\" That was what he said. He is out there on out of the mainstream. He is very passionate. My argument with the governor is, do we want this country to go that far left. And I wish we had time to let me explain. But I salute him for his passion. We just have a big difference on where this country should be led, and in what direction it ought to go.(Applause)LEHRER: Peter, a question? Question for the vice president, Peter.JENNINGS: I\\'d actually like to follow up if I may on this mention you\\'ve made of his card carrying membership in the American Civil Liberties Union. You\\'ve used the phrase \"card carrying\" so many times since Governor Dukakis first acknowledged that he was a card carrying member of the ACLU that some people have come to believe that you\\'ve used it to brand him in some way, to identify him as people were identified in the 1950\\'s as less than patriotic. I\\'d like to know why you keep repeating the phrase, and what\\'s the important issue here? What is so wrong with the governor being a member of an organization which has come to the defense of, among other people, Colonel Oliver North?BUSH: Nothings wrong with it. But just take a look at the positions of the ACLU. But, Peter, please understand, the liberals do not like me talking about liberal They don\\'t like it when I say that he says he\\'s a card carrying member. Now, if that quote was wrong, he can repudiate it, right here. I\\'ve seen it authoritatively written twice, and if I\\'ve done him an injustice, and he didn\\'t say it, I\\'m very, very sorry. But I don\\'t agree with a lot of - most of the positions of the ACLU. I simply don\\'t want to see the ratings on movies. I don\\'t want my ten year old grandchild to go into an X-rated movie. I like those ratings systems. I don\\'t think they\\'re right to try to take the tax exemption away from the Catholic Church. I don\\'t want to see the kiddie pornographic laws repealed; I don\\'t want to see \"under God\" come out from our currency. Now, these are all positions of the ACLU. And I don\\'t agree with them. He has every right to exercise his passion, as what he said, a strong, progressive liberal. I don\\'t agree with that. I come from a different point. And I think I\\'m more in touch with the mainstream of America. They raised the same thing with me on the Pledge of Allegiance. You see, I\\'d have found a way to sign that bill. Governor Thompson of Illinois did. I\\'m not questioning his patriotism. He goes out and says the man is questioning my patriotism. And then all the liberal columnists join in. I am not. I am questioning his judgment on these matters, or where he\\'s coming from He has every right to do it. But I believe that\\'s not what the American people want, and when he said, when he said at the convention, ideology doesn\\'t matter, just competence, he was moving away from his own record, from what his passion has been over the years. And that\\'s all I\\'m trying to do, is put it in focus. And I hope people don\\'t think that I\\'m questioning his patriotism when I say he used his words to describe his participation in that organization.LEHRER: Governor, a response.DUKAKIS: Well, I hope this is the first and last time I have to say this. Of course, the vice president is questioning my patriotism. I don\\'t think there\\'s any question about that, and I resent it. I resent it. My parents came to this country as immigrants. They taught me that this was the greatest country in the world. I\\'m in public service because I love this country. I believe in it. And nobody\\'s going to question my patriotism as the vice president has now repeatedly. The fact of the matter is if the Pledge of Allegiance was the acid test of one\\'s patriotism--the vice president\\'s been the presiding officer in the United States Senate for the past seven and a half years. To the best of my knowledge he\\'s never once suggested that a session of the Senate begin with the Pledge of Allegiance.(Applause)DUKAKIS: Mr. Bush, I don\\'t question your patriotism. When you\\'re attacked for your military record, I immediately said it was inappropriate, it had no place in this campaign, and I rejected it. I would hope that from this point on, we get to the issues that affect the vast majority of Americans, jobs, schools, health care, housing, the environment. Those are the concerns of the people that are watching us tonight. Not labels that we attach to each other, questions about each other\\'s patriotism and loyalty.LEHRER: The time is up, governor. Let\\'s go now to John Mashek, again. A question for the vice president.MASHEK: Mr. Vice President, in a debate during the Republican primaries, you said most of the nation\\'s homeless are suffering from mental illness, an assertion immediately challenged by one of your rivals. Estimates of the homeless range from a low of 250,000 by the government, to around three million, including working families and their children. What commitment are you willing to make tonight to this voiceless segment of our society?BUSH: I want to see the McKinney Act fully funded. I believe that that would help in terms of shelter. I want to see - when I talked at our convention about a thousand points of light, I was talking about the enormous numbers of shelters and organizations that help. The governor\\'s wife has been very active in the homeless. My campaign chairman, Secretary Jim Baker\\'s wife. This isn\\'t government. These are people that care, that are trying to give of themselves. The government has a role. It is to fully fund the McKinney Act. There are certain army bases that the act calls for that can be used in certain cases to shelter people when it\\'s rough. And so I think that we\\'re on the right track. I don\\'t see this, incidentally, as a Democrat or a Republican or a liberal or conservative idea. I see an involvement by a thousand points of light. I see the funding that is required, and I hope the Congress will fully fund this bill. They gave it a great deal of conscience and a great deal of work. And we\\'re on the track on this one. But - and I, look, mental - that was a little overstated it. I\\'d say around 30 percent. And I think maybe we could look back over our shoulders and wonder whether it was right to let all those mental patients out. Maybe we need to do a better job in mental clinics to help them. Because there is a major problem there. A lot of them are mentally sick. And we\\'ve got to attend to them. But fully, my short range answer is fully fund that McKinney Act.LEHRER: Governor, a response.DUKAKIS: Well, this is another fundamental difference that I have with the vice president, just as I do in the case of health care for 37 million members of working families in this country who don\\'t have health insurance. The problem, Mr. Bush, is that you\\'ve cut back by 90 percent on our commitment to affordable housing for families of low and moderate income. And when you do that, you\\'ve have homeless families. We didn\\'t have two and a half million, or three million homeless people living on streets and in doorways in this country ten years ago. We\\'ve got to begin to get back to the business of building and rehabilitating housing for families of low and moderate income in this country; housing for young families that they can look forward some day to buy. We\\'ve got communities in this country increasingly where our own kids can\\'t afford to live in the communities that they grew up in. That\\'s an essential commitment. And I think the housing community is ready. But it\\'s going to take a president who\\'s committed to housing, who\\'s had experience in building and rehabilitating housing who understands that affordable housing for families of low and moderate income, for young families, first time home buyers, is an essential part of the American dream. And while I\\'m all for the McKinney bill, that, by itself, simply won\\'t do. We\\'ve got to have a president that can lead on this issue, that can work with the Congress, and I\\'m prepared to do so. This is one of the most important priorities that faces this country.LEHRER: John, a question for the governor.MASHEK: Governor, you\\'ve mentioned the American dream of home ownership, and it\\'s certainly become an impossible one for many of the young people of our nation who are caught up in this economic squeeze of the middle class, as you\\'ve said so frequently during the campaign. And yet in spite of your answer just a few minutes ago, what promise can you realistically hold out to these people that with the costs of housing going up, and with limited help available from Washington, are we destined to become a nation of renters?DUKAKIS: Well, I certainly hope not. And it\\'s all a question of what our priorities are. Mr. Bush talked about values. I agree with him. What are our values? Isn\\'t providing housing for families of low and moderate income, isn\\'t it making possible for young families, first time home buyers to own their own home some day something that\\'s part of the American dream? I think so. You know, back after World War II when we had hundreds of thousands of GIs who came back from the war, we didn\\'t sit around. We went out and built housing. The government was very much involved; so was the housing industry; so was the banking industry; so were housing advocates; so were non-profit agencies; so were governors and mayors and people all over this country who believe deeply in home ownership and affordable housing. Now, that\\'s the kind of leadership that I want to provide as president of the United States. This isn\\'t a question of a little charity for the homeless. This is a question of organizing the housing community. I\\'ve talked to bankers and builders and developers, the housing advocates, community development agencies, and they want leadership from Washington. Washington, by itself, can\\'t do it all. We shouldn\\'t expect that. But governors are ready; mayors are ready. Builders and community leaders are ready. It will require some funds, John. And we ought to be prepared to provide those funds. But that, too, will require some choices. Mr. Bush wants to spend billions and trillions on Star Wars. Well, that\\'s a choice we have to make, isn\\'t it? Do we spend money on that weapon system in the billions and trillions, or is providing some decent and affordable housing for families of this country something that is at least as important and probably more so. Because it\\'s so essential to our economic strength and to our future. Now, that\\'s the kind of presidency I believe in. And simply to say, well, the McKinney bill will do it just doesn\\'t do. We need a president who will lead on this issue, who has had experience on this issue. It\\'s the kind of priority that will be at the top of our list beginning in January of 1989.LEHRER: A response, Mr. Vice President.BUSH: I think the governor is blurring housing and the homeless. Let\\'s talk about housing which the question was. When you talk to those bankers, did they discuss where interest rates were when your party controlled the White House? Ten days before I took the oath of office as president they were 21 and a half percent. Now, how does that grab you for increasing housing? Housing is up. We are serving a million more families now. But we\\'re not going to do it in that old Democratic, liberal way of trying to build more bricks and mortars. Go out and take a look at St. Louis at some of that effort. It is wrong. I favor home ownership. I want to see more vouchers. I want to see control of some of these projects, and I want to keep the interest rates down. They\\'re half, now of what they were when we came into office, and with my policy of getting this deficit under control, they\\'ll be a lot less. But if we spend and spend and spend, that is going to wrap up the housing market, and we\\'ll go right back to the days of the misery index and malaise that President Reagan and I have overcome - thank God for the United States on that one.LEHRER: All right, the next question is to the governor. Ann Groer will ask it.GROER: Governor Dukakis, is there a conflict between your opposition to the death penalty and your support for abortion on demand, even though in the minds of many people, that\\'s also killing?DUKAKIS: No, I don\\'t think there is. There are two very different issues here, and they\\'ve got to be dealt with separately. I\\'m opposed to the death penalty. I think everybody knows that. I\\'m also very tough on violent crime. And that\\'s one of the reasons why my state has cut crime by more than any other industrial state in America. It\\'s one of the reasons why we have the lowest murder rate of any industrial state in the country. It\\'s one of the reasons why we have a drug education and prevention program that is reaching out and helping youngsters all over our state, the kind of thing I want to do as president of the United States. You know, the vice president says he wants to impose the death penalty on drug traffickers, and yet his administration has a federal furlough program which is one of the most permissive in the country, which gave last year 7,000 furloughs to drug traffickers and drug pushers, the same people that he says he now wants to execute. The issue of abortion is a very difficult issue, one that I think that we all have to wrestle with, we have to come to terms with. I don\\'t favor abortion. I don\\'t think it\\'s a good thing. I don\\'t think most people do. The question is who makes the decision. And I think it has to be the woman, in the exercise of her own conscience and religious beliefs, that makes that decision.LEHRER: Response, Mr. Vice President.BUSH: Well, the Massachusetts furlough program was unique. It was the only one in the nation that furloughed murderers who had not served enough time to be eligible for parole. The federal program doesn\\'t do that. No other state programs do that. And I favor the death penalty. I know it\\'s tough and honest people can disagree. But when a narcotics wrapped up guy goes in and murders a police officer, I think they ought to pay with their life. And I do believe it would be inhibiting. And so I am not going to furlough men like Willie Horton, and I would meet with their, the victims of his last escapade, the rape and the brutalization of the family down there in Maryland. Maryland would not extradite Willie Horton, the man who was furloughed, the murderer, because they didn\\'t want him to be furloughed again. And so we have a fundamental difference on this one. And I think most people know my position on the sanctity of life. I favor adoption. I do not favor abortion.LEHRER: Question for the vice president, Ann?GROER: Yes. Mr. Vice President, I\\'d like to stay with abortion for just a moment if I might. Over the years you have expressed several positions, while opposing nearly all forms of government payment for it. You now say that you support abortion only in cases of rape, incest, or threat to a mother\\'s life, and you also support a constitutional amendment that if ratified would outlaw most abortions. But if abortions were to become illegal again, do you think that the women who defy the law and have them anyway, as they did before it was okayed by the Supreme Court, and the doctors who perform them should go to jail?BUSH: I haven\\'t sorted out the penalties. But I do know, I do know that I oppose abortion. And I favor adoption. And if we can get this law changed, everybody should make the extraordinary effort to take these kids that are unwanted and sometimes aborted, take the - let them come to birth, and then put them in a family where they will be loved. And you see, yes, my position has evolved. And it\\'s continuing to evolve, and it\\'s evolving in favor of life. And I have had a couple of exceptions that I support - rape, incest and the life of the mother. Sometimes people feel a little uncomfortable talking about this, but it\\'s much clearer for me now. As I\\'ve seen abortions sometimes used as a birth control device, for heavens sakes. See the millions of these killings accumulate, and this is one where you can have an honest difference of opinion. We certainly do. But no, I\\'m for the sanctity of life, and once that illegality is established, then we can come to grips with the penalty side, and of course there\\'s got to be some penalties to enforce the law, whatever they may be.LEHRER: Governor.DUKAKIS: Well, I think what the vice president is saying is that he\\'s prepared to brand a woman a criminal for making this decision. It\\'s as simple as that. I don\\'t think it\\'s enough to come before the American people who are watching us tonight and say, well, I haven\\'t sorted it out. This is a very, very difficult and fundamental decision that all of us have to make. And what he is saying, if I understand him correctly, is that he\\'s prepared to brand a woman a criminal for making this choice.BUSH: I just -DUKAKIS: Let me finish. Let me simply say that I think it has to be the woman in the exercise of her own conscience and religious beliefs that makes that decision, and I think that\\'s the right approach, the right decision, and I would hope by this time that Mr. Bush had sorted out this issue and come to terms with it as I have. I respect his right to disagree with me. But I think it\\'s important that we have a position, that we take it, and we state it to the American people.LEHRER: Peter Jennings, a question for the vice president.JENNINGS: Mr. Vice President, I\\'m struck by your discussion of women and the sanctity of life. And it leads me to recall your own phrase, that you are haunted by the lives which children in our inner cities live. Certainly the evidence is compelling. There\\'s an explosion of single parent families. And by any measure, these single parent families, many with unwanted children, are the source of poverty, school drop outs, crime, which many people in the inner city simply feel is out of control. If it haunts you so, why over the eight years of the Reagan-Bush administration have so many programs designed to help the inner cities been eliminated or cut?BUSH: One of the reasons, and I first would like to know which programs you\\'re talking about, and then we could talk on the merits of the programs. But, you see, my fundamental philosophy is give local and state government as much control as possible. That might be the explanation, if you tell me the program. I do strongly support the WIC program. I think it is good. I think part of the answer to this haunting of these children that are out there and suffering lies in extension of Medicaid, to challenge the states, and maybe we\\'re going to have to enforce more on the states in terms of Medicaid taking care of these. But, Peter, so much of it is, gets into a whole other phase of things. The neighborhood, the kind of environment people are growing up in, and that leads me to the programs I\\'m talking about in terms of education. I think that part of it is the crime infested neighborhoods, and that\\'s why I\\'m a strong believer in trying to control crimes in the neighborhood, why I was so pleased to be endorsed by the policemen on the beat, the Boston Police Department the other day. I think they understand my commitment to helping them in the neighborhoods. And so it\\'s a combination of these things. But do not erode out of the system the thousand points of light. The people that are out there trying to help these kids, the programs like cities and schools, the work that Barbara Bush is doing so people can learn to read in this country and then go on and break this cycle of poverty. I\\'m for Head Start and moving that up. And I\\'ve already made a proposal - and yes, it will cost some money. But I favor that. So these are the combination of things I want, and the fact that I don\\'t think the federal government can endorse a $35 billion program does not mean I have less compassion than the person who endorses such a program.LEHRER: Governor.DUKAKIS: Well, I must have been living through a different eight years then the ones the vice president\\'s been living through, because this administration has cut and slashed and cut and slashed programs for children, for nutrition, for the kinds of things that can help these youngsters to live better lives. It\\'s cut federal aid to education; it\\'s cut Pell grants and loans to close the door to college opportunity on youngsters all over this country. And that, too, is a major difference between the vice president and me. Let me just give you one other example. We have a great many people, hundreds of thousands of people living on public assistance in this country. The 50 governors of this nation have proposed to the Congress that we help those families to get off of welfare, help those youngsters, help their mothers to become independent and self-sufficient. It\\'s taken months and months and months to get Mr. Bush and the administration to support that legislation, and they\\'re still resisting. That\\'s the way you help people. Being haunted, a thousand points of light - I don\\'t know what that means. I know what strong political leadership is. I know what\\'s happened over the course of the past eight years. These programs have been cut and slashed and butchered, and they\\'ve hurt kids all over this country.LEHRER: A question for the governor, Peter.JENNINGS: Governor, the crisis is no less a crisis for you if you are elected president. Where would you get the money to devote to the inner cities which is clearly needed. And can you be specific about the programs not only you\\'d reinstate, but the more imaginative ones that you\\'d begin.DUKAKIS: Well, I said a few minutes ago, Peter, that you could improve the lives of families and youngsters and save money at the same time. Welfare reform is one way to do it. If we invest in job training, in child care for those youngsters, in some extended health benefits so that that mother and her kids don\\'t lose their health benefits when she goes to work, we can help literally hundreds of thousands, if not millions of families, to get off of welfare, to become independent and self-sufficient, to be taxpaying citizens, and to improve their lives, the quality of lives, their futures, and the futures of those children.That\\'s just one example of how you can save money and improve the quality of life at the same time. In my own state, for example, we now have that universal health care system, which the vice president opposes, I think very unwisely. One of the greatest barriers to opportunity for a family and for those children is the threat that they mat lose their health insurance. Think about that father down there in Houston who has to tell his youngster that he can\\'t play little league ball that he can\\'t go out on the ball field because he\\'s afraid he\\'s going to get hurt.And yet, Mr. Bush says well, I don\\'t think we ought to expect business to provide health insurance for their employees, when responsible employers, a majority of employers in this country do and are paying more for their insurance to reimburse hospitals for free care on account of people that are not insured, that have to go to that hospital.So these are the ways that you help families, you help youngsters to live better lives, and more decent lives. Were ready to go to work at the state and local level, all of us. I know the private sector is. People are all over the country. But it takes presidential leadership. It takes a commitment to being involved and the leading. And that\\'s the kind of presidency I want to lead.LEHRER: Mr. Vice President.BUSH: What troubles me is that when I talk of the voluntary sector and a thousand points of light and a thousand different ways to help on these problems, the man has just said he doesn\\'t understand what I\\'m talking about.This is the problem I have with the big spending liberals. They think the only way to do it is for the federal government to do it all. The fact happens to be that education spending is up by the federal government; it is up. It is not down.But here\\'s the point he misses. The federal government spends seven percent of the total on education, and the rest of the state governments and local governments and the thousand points of lightened I\\'m talking about private schools and private church schools and things of this nature--are putting up 93 percent.But the federal spending for education is up, and I want to be the education president, because I want to see us do better. We\\'re putting more money per child into education, and we are not performing as we should. We\\'ve gotten away fro values and the fundamentals. And I would like to urge the school superintendents and the others around the country to stand up now and keep us moving forward on a path towards real excellence.And we can do it. But itÏ€s not going to be dedicated by some federal bureaucracy in Washington, D.C.LEHRER: All right, let\\'s move now to some questions on foreign and national security policy. John Mashek will ask the first question of the governor.MASHEK: Governor, the vice president continually refers to your lack of experience, weakness, naivete on foreign policy and national security matters. He says you are prepared to eliminate weapons system that will result in the unilateral disarmament of this country. Is that true?DUKAKIS: Of course not. Of course that\\'s a charge that\\'s always made against any governor who runs for the presidency. I think it was one of the things that Mr. Bush said about Mr. Reagan back in 1980. Remember that, George? And yet some of our finest presidents, some of our strongest international leaders were governors-Franklin Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Theodore Roosevelt.Its not the amount of time you spend in Washington. It\\'s not the length of your resume. It\\'s your strength, it\\'s your values, it\\'s the quality of the people you pick. It\\'s your understanding of the forces of change that are sweeping the world, and whether or not you\\'re in a position to provide leadership to make those forces of change work for us and not against us.The vice president has a long resume. But it didn\\'t stop him from endorsing the sale of arms to the Ayatollah. And we now know that he was not out of the loop; he was in meeting after meeting listening to Secretary Shultz and Secretary Weinberger opposing that, and yet he supported it.His experience didn\\'t prevent him from participating or involving or in some way being involved in the relationship between this government and Mr. Noriega and drug trafficking in Panama.He went to Philippines in the early 80Ï€s and commended Ferdinand Macros for his commitment to democracy. And he continues to support a failed policy in Central America which is getting worse and worse, and which has in fact increased Cuban and Soviet influence in that region.So I don\\'t believe that the fact you\\'ve got that long resume or had that experience is the real question. The question is values; the question is strength, the question is your willingness to provide the kind of leadership that must be provided. I\\'m ready to provide that leadership. I want to be the commander in chief of this country. I think it take fresh leadership now, and an understanding of those forces of change to provide the kind of strength that we need, and perhaps the vice president can explain what he was doing when he supported the trading of arms to terrorist nation, and his involvement in Panama and that endorsement of Mr. Macros. But I don\\'t think it\\'s just experience that makes the difference. It\\'s strength; it\\'s values.LEHRER: Mr. Vice President.BUSH: Well, I thought the question was about defense. The governor was for a nuclear freeze that would have locked in a thousand Soviet intermediate nuclear force weapons and zero for the West. And because we didn\\'t listen to the freeze advocates, and strengthen the defense of this country, we now have the first arms control agreement in the nuclear age. Now, we\\'re sitting down and talking to the Soviets about strategic arms, and he wants to do away with the Midgetman and the MX, the modernization or our nuclear capability. That is not the way you deal with the Soviets. I\\'ve met Mr. Gorbachev. Met Mr. Shevardnadze and talked substance with him the other day. These people are tough. But now we have a chance. I few have experience and now how to handle it, but please do not go back to the days when the military was as weak as they could be, when the morale was down, and when we were the laughing stock around the world.And now we are back, because we have strengthened the defenses of this country, and believe me, I don\\'t want to see us return to those days.As to Ferdinand Marcos, he isn\\'t there any more. It was under our administration that Mrs. Aquino came in. But I\\'ll tell you what I was thinking of. I flew a combat mission, my last one was over Manila. And he was down there fighting against imperialism. And he had just-LEHRER: Mr. Vice PresidentBUSH: And he just lifted martial law. And he just called for new elections. And all of those things happened because the Philippines do crave democracy. And out he goes.LEHRER: Mr. Vice President, your time is up. John, a question for the vice president.MASHEK: Mr. Vice President, the governor has suggested that you\\'ve never met a weapons system that you didn\\'t like or want. Are you prepared to tell the voters one system in this time of tight budgetary restraints and problems at the Pentagon that you\\'d be willing to cut or even eliminate that wouldn\\'t endanger national security?BUSH: I don\\'t think it\\'s a question of eliminating. I can tell him some I\\'m against. A-6F, for example. DIVAD. And I can go on and on. Minuteman III, penetration systems. I mean, there\\'s plenty of them that I oppose, but what I am not going to do, when we are negotiating with the Soviet Union, sitting down talking to Mr. Gorbachev about how we achieve a 50 percent reduction in our strategic weapons, I\\'m not going to give away a couple of aces I that very tough card game. I\\'m simply not going to do that.And under me, when I lead this country, the secretary of defense is going to have to make the choices, between how we keep, how we protect the survivability of our nuclear deployment on the Midgetman missile, or on the Minuteman, whatever it is. We\\'re going to have to-the MX. We\\'re going to have to do that. It\\'s Christmas.(Laughter)BUSH: Wouldn\\'t it be nice to be perfect?DUKAKIS: I hope it isn\\'t Christmas when you make that decision.BUSH: wouldn\\'t it be nice to be the ice man so you never make a mistake? These are the-my answer is do not make these unilateral cuts, and everybody now realizes that peace through strength works, and so this is where I have a big difference.Of course we\\'re going to have to make some determination on this, and we\\'re going to have to make it on the convention forces. But now we\\'ve got a very good concept called competitive strategies. We will do what we do best. It\\'s a strategy that we\\'ve been working on for a couple of years. It is going to take us to much better advantage in conventional forces.But look, let me sum it up. I want to be the president that gets conventional forces balance. I want to be the one to banish chemical and biological weapons from the face of the earth. But you have to have a little bit of experience to know where to start. And I think I\\'ve had that.LEHRER: Governor?DUKAKIS: Well, first let me say with respect to the freeze, that back in the spring of 1982 Mr. Bush was a lot more sympathetic to the freeze than he seems to be today. As a matter of fact, he said it was not and should not be subject to partisan demagoguery because it was too important for the United States or for the world. I didn\\'t hear, John, exactly where he was going to cut and what he was going to do.But I know this, we have serious financial problems in this country. We\\'ve piled up over a trillion dollars in debt and the next president of the United States is going to have to make some choices.Mr. Bush wants to spend billions on Star Wars. He apparently wants to spend billions on the MX on railroad cars, a weapons system we don\\'t need and can\\'t afford. I thought the administration was opposed to the Midgetman. I thought the administration was at the negotiating table in Geneva suggesting that we ban mobile missile systems entirely. But those are the choices the next president of the United States is going to have to make.I\\'m for the Stealth, I\\'m for the D-5, I\\'m for going ahead with the advance Cruise missile. But I don\\'t think we need these other systems. I don\\'t think we need them to remain strong. We\\'ve got to move ahead with the strategic arms negotiation process, with the comprehensive test ban treaty and with negotiations leading to conventional force reduction in Europe with deeper cuts on the Soviet side and Senator Bentsen and I will pursue that policy.LEHRER: Anne Groer, a question for the Vice President.GROER: Well, Mr. Vice President, you said you\\'ve met with Secretary General Gorbachev, you\\'ve met with Mr. Shevardnadze, but for the last forty years Americans have been taught to regard the Soviet Union as the enemy. Yet, President Reagan has signed two arms control treaties and he\\'s promised to share Star Wars technology with the very country he once called the evil empire. So, perhaps you can tell us this evening, should we be doing a lot to help the economics and the social development of a country that we have so long regarded as an adversary?BUSH: What I think we ought to do is take a look at perestroika and glasnost, welcome them, but keep our eyes open. Be cautious. Because the Soviet change is not fully established yet. Yes, I think it\\'s fine to do business with them. And, so, I\\'m encouraged with what I see when I talk to Mr. -- what I hear when I talk to Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Shevardnadze, but can they pull it off.And when they have a --they a --deals that are good for us, as China started to do--the changes in China since Barbara and I lived there is absolutely amazing, in terms of incentive, in partnership and things of this nature. And now the Soviet Union seems to be walking down that same path. We should encourage that. We ought to say this is good.But where I differ with my opponent is I am not going to make unilateral cuts in our strategic defend systems or support some freeze when they have superiority. I\\'m not going to do that, because I think the jury is still out on the Soviet experiment.And the interesting place-one of the things that fascinates me about this perestroika and glasnost is wheats going to happen in Eastern Europe. You see the turmoil in Poland today. And I think we have enormous opportunity for trade. I don\\'t want to go back to the Carter grain embargo on the Soviets. We are once again reliable suppliers and I would never use food as a political tool like our predecessors did. But this is an exciting time. But all I\\'m suggesting is let\\'s not be naÃ¯ve in dealing with the Soviets and make a lot of unilateral cuts hoping against hope that they will match our bid.Look at the INF treaty. And if we haven\\'t learned from the negotiating history on that, we\\'ll never learn. The freeze people were wrong. The Reagan-Bush administration was right.LEHRER: Governor Dukakis.DUKAKIS: It was a very different George Bush who was talking much more sympathetically about the freeze in the spring of 1982 than he is today. And you were right then, George, when you said it was no time for partisan demagoguery. Nobody is suggesting that we unilaterally disarm or somehow reduce our strength, of course not. What we\\'re talking about is a combination of a strong and effective and credible nuclear deterrent. Strong, well-equipped, well-trained, well-maintained conventional forces. And at the same time a willingness to move forward steadily, thoughtfully cautiously.We have serious differences with the Soviet Union. We have very fundamental differences about human rights, democracy and our basic system, our basic view of human beings and of what life is all about. But there are opportunities there now. Senator Bentsen and I have a plan for the 1990Ï€s and beyond. Mr. Bush and Mr. Quayle do not.And we want to pursue that plan in a way which will bring down the level of nuclear armament, will build a more stable and more peaceful world while making choices here at home. Let\\'s not forget that our national security and our economic security go hand in hand. We cannot be strong militarily when we\\'re teeter-tottering on top of a mountain of debt which has been created in the past eight years. That\\'s why we need a Democratic administration in Washington in 1989.(Applause)LEHRER: Anne Groer, a question for the Governor.GROER: Yes. Governor Dukakis, speaking of seeming changes of position, you have gone from calling the Strategic Defense Initiative, or Star Wars, a fantasy and a fraud, to saying recently that you would continue SDI research and might even deploy the system if Congress supported such a move. Why the change of heart?DUKAKIS: No, there\\'s been no change of heart. I said from the beginning that we ought to continue research into the strategic system at about the level that was added in 1983, that\\'s about a billion dollars a year. But I don\\'t know of any reputable scientist who believed that this system, at least as originally conceived could possibly work, this notion of some kind of astrodome over ourselves that could protect us from enemy attack. It makes real sense. And as a matter of fact, the system that the administration is now talking about is very different from the one that was originally proposed in 1983.So, I\\'m for continued research, but I also want strong conventional forces. Now, the other day, Mr. Bush said, â‰¥Well, if we continue with Star War-Star Wars-we have to cut some place.â‰¤ He hasn\\'t told us where. We know where they\\'re cutting. We know where you\\'re cutting right now. You\\'re cutting into the fiber and muscle of our conventional forces. You\\'re cutting back on maintenance and equipment.An Air Force General not too long ago in Europe who said that pretty soon we\\'d have airplanes without engines, tank commanders who can\\'t drive their tanks more than three-quarters of a mile, because they don\\'t have enough fuel. Coast Guard cutters tied up at the dock this summer, not patrolling. They\\'re supposed to be our first line of defense against drugs and the war against drugs, because they don\\'t have enough fuel.You have to make choices. We\\'re not making those choices. And to spend billions and billions of dollars as Mr. Bush apparently wants to, although, he, himself has been all over the lot on this issue lately-on Star Wars-in my judgment makes no sense at all. We need a strong, credible, effective nuclear deterrent. We have 13,000 strategic nuclear warheads right now on land, on sea and in the air, enough to blow up the Soviet Union forty times over. They have about 12,000. So, we\\'ve got to move forward with those negotiations, get the level of strategic weapons down.But to continue to commit billions to this system makes no sense at all and I think Mr. Bush has been reconsidering his position over the course of the past few weeks. That\\'s-at least that\\'s what I read. Maybe he\\'ll tell us where he stand on it tonight.LEHRER: Mr. Vice President.BUSH: I\\'m not reconsidering my position. Two questions: How do you deter nuclear attack without modernizing our nuclear forces when the Soviets are modernizing and how come you spend-willing to spend a dime on something that you consider a fantasy and a fraud. Those are two hypo-rhetorical questions.He is the man on conventional forces that wants to eliminate two carrier battle groups. The armed forces, the conventional forces of the United States have never been more ready. Every single one of the Joint Chiefs will testify to the fact that readiness is in an historic high. And secondly, in terms of the cutting of the Coast Guard, the Democratic controlled Congress, so please help us with that, who cut $70 million from the Coast Guard out of the interdiction effort on narcotics.(Applause)BUSH: He\\'s got to get this thing more clear. Why do you spend a billion dollars on something you think is a fantasy and a fraud? I will fully research it, go forward as fast as we can. We\\'ve set up the levels of funding and when it is deployable, I will deploy it. That is my position on SDI and it\\'s never wavered a bit.LEHRER: Peter Jennings, a question for Governor Dukakis.JENNINGS: Well, Governor, and Vice President Bush, you\\'ve both talked tonight about hard choices. Let me try to give you one. Somewhere in the Middle East tonight, nine Americans are being held hostage. If you are commander-in-chief and Americans are held hostage, what will be more important to you, their individual fate, or the commitment that the United States Government must never negotiate with terrorists. And if any Americans are held hostage and you become president, to what lengths would you go to rescue them?DUKAKIS: Peter, it\\'s one of the most agonizing decisions a president has to make. These are American citizens, we care deeply about them. Their families care deeply about them, want them back and understandably so and we want to do everything we can to bring them back.But if there\\'s one thing we also understand it is that you cannot make concessions to terrorists, ever, ever. Because if you do, it\\'s an open invitation to other terrorists to take hostages and to blackmail us. And that\\'s the tragedy of the Iran/Contra scandal.As a matter of fact, Mr. Bush was the Chairman of a task force on international terrorism which issued a report shortly before that decision was made and said, and rightly so, that we never ever can make concessions to terrorists and hostage takers. And, yet, after sitting through meeting after meeting, he endorsed that decision, endorsed the sale of arms to the Ayatollah in exchange for hostages, one of the most tragic, one of the most mistaken foreign policy decisions we\\'ve ever made in this country and I dare say encouraged others to take hostages as we now know.So, there can be no concessions under any circumstances, because if we do it\\'s an open invitation to others to do the same. We\\'ve got to be tough on international terrorism. We\\'ve got to treat it as international crime. We\\'ve got to attack at all points, we\\'ve go to use undercover operations. We have to be prepared to use military force against terrorist base camps, we have to work closely with our allies to make sure that they\\'re working with us and we with them and we can give no quarter when it comes to breaking the back of international terrorism.Yes, we should make every effort to try to help those hostages come home, but it can never be because we make concessions. That was a tragic mistake that we made, a mistake that Mr. Bush made and others made and it should never ever be made again.LEHRER: Mr. Vice President?BUSH: I wrote the anti-terrorist report for this government. It is the best anti-terrorist report written. Yes, we shouldn\\'t trade arms for hostages. But we have made vast improvements in our anti-terrorism. Now, it\\'s fine to say that sometimes you have to hit base camps, but when the president saw this state sponsored-fingerprints of Muammar Khadaffi on the loss of American life, he hit Libya. And my opponent was unwilling to support that action.DUKAKIS: That\\'s not true. That\\'s not true.BUSH: And since that action, terrorist action against the United States citizens have gone down.DUKAKIS: That\\'s not true.BUSH: And I have long ago said I supported the president on this other matter. And I\\'ve said mistakes were made. Clearly nobody\\'s going to think the president started out thinking he was going to trade arms for hostages. That is a very serious charge against the president. The matter has been thoroughly looked into. But the point is sometimes the action-(Laughter)BUSH: - has to be taken by the Federal Government and when we took action, it had a favorable response.LEHRER: A question for the Vice President. Peter?JENNINGS: It seems perhaps a good subject, Mr. Vice President, on which to make the point that you\\'ve campaigned vigorously as part of a leadership team. But so far you won\\'t tell the American people in considerable measure what advice you gave the president, including the sale of arms to Iran and what should have been done about the hostages. To the best of my knowledge there\\'s no Constitutional requirement which prevents you from doing so. Jimmy Carter urged his Vice President, Walter Mondale, to tell the American people. Would you now ask President Reagan for permission to tell the American people what advice you did give him? And if you don\\'t, how do we judge your judgment in the Oval Office in the last eight years?BUSH: You\\'re judged by the whole record. You\\'re judged by the entire record. Are we closer to peace? Are we doing better in anti-terrorism? Should we have listened to my opponent who wanted to send the UN into the Persian Gulf or in spite of the mistakes of the past, are we doing better there? How is our credibility with the GCC countries on the Western side of the Gulf. Is Iran talking to Iraq about peace? You judge on the record. Are the Soviets coming out of Afghanistan? How does it look in a program he called or some one of these marvelous Boston adjective up there and-about Angola-now, we have a chance-several Bostonians don\\'t like it, but the rest of the country will understand.(Applause)BUSH: Now we have a chance. Now we have a chance. And, so, I think that I\\'d leave it right there and say that you judge on the whole record. And let me say this-all he can talk about-he goes around ranting about Noriega. Now, I\\'ve told you what the intelligence briefing he received said about that. He can talk about Iran/Contra and also-I\\'ll make a deal with you, I will take the blame for those two incidents if you give me half the credit for all the good things that have happened in world peace since Ronald Reagan and I took over from the Carter administration.(Applause)BUSH: I still have a couple of minutes left. And there is a difference principle -LEHRER: Sorry, Mr. Vice President.BUSH: It\\'s only on yellow here. Wait a minute.(Laughter)LEHRER: I\\'m wrong. Go ahead. My apologies.BUSH: Jim -LEHRER: You said nobody\\'s perfect.BUSH: I said I wasn\\'t perfect. Where was I?DUKAKIS: 25th of December, Mr. Vice President.(Laughter)BUSH: I finished.DUKAKIS: He can have another ten seconds if he wants, Jim.LEHRER: Governor, you have a minute to respond.DUKAKIS: Well, the matter of judgment is very important. And I think it\\'s important to understand what happened here.A report on international terrorism chaired by the Vice President was released and made some very specific recommendations about how to deal with terrorism. They were ignored. The Vice President ignored them. He says mistakes were made. Very serious mistakes in judgment were made. He says, â‰¥Well, let\\'s concede that the administration has been doing business with Noriega. Has made him a part of our foreign policy and has been funneling aid to Contras through convicted drug dealers.â‰¤I think those are very very serious questions of judgment, which those of you who are watching us here tonight have a right to judge and review. We\\'re not going to make those kinds of mistakes. You cannot make concessions to terrorists. If you do, you invite the taking of more hostages. That\\'s a basic principle. It was ignored in that case and it was a very very serious mistake in judgment.LEHRER: A question from John Mashek. It goes to the Vice President.MASHEK: Mr. Vice President, Democrats and even some Republicans are still expressing reservations about the qualifications and credentials of Senator Dan Quayle of Indiana, your chosen running mate, to be a heartbeat away from the presidency. What do you see in him that others do not?(Laughter)BUSH: I see a young man that was elected to the Senate twice, to the House of Representatives twice. I see a man who is young and I am putting my confidence in a whole generation of people that are in their 30Ï€s and 40Ï€s. I see a man that took the leadership in the Job Training Partnership Act and that retrains people in this highly competitive changing society we\\'re in, so if a person loses his hob he is retrained for a benefit-for a-work that will be productive and he won\\'t have to go on one of these many programs that the liberal-talking about.I see a young man who is a knowledgeable-in defense and there are three people on our ticket that are knowledgeable-in the whole-in the race-knowledgeable in defense and Dan Quayle is one of them and I am one of them. And I believe that he will be outstanding. And he took a tremendous pounding and everybody now knows that he took a very unfair pounding. And I\\'d like each person to say did I jump to conclusions running down rumors that were so outrageous and so brutal. And he\\'s kept his head up. And he will do very very well. And he has my full confidence and he\\'ll have the confidence of people that are in their 30Ï€s and 40Ï€s and more. So, judge the man on his record not on the-lot of rumors and innuendo and trying to fool around with his name.My opponent says J. Danforth Quayle. Do you know who J. Danforth was, he was a man who gave his life in World War II, so ridiculing a person\\'s name is a little beneath this process. And he\\'ll do very well when we get into the debates.(Applause)DUKAKIS: Well, when it comes to ridicule, George, you win a gold medal. I think we can agree on that in the course of this campaign.(Applause)BUSH: Just the facts.DUKAKIS: But did I-did I sense a desire that maybe Lloyd Bentsen ought to be your running mate when you said there are three people on your ticket?BUSH: No, I think the debate ought to be between you and Lloyd.DUKAKIS: I think the American people have a right to judge us on this question, on how we picked a running mate, a person who is a heartbeat away from the presidency. I picked Lloyd Bentsen, distinguished, strong, mature, a leader in the Senate, somebody whose qualifications nobody has questioned. Mr. Bush picked Dan Quayle.I doubt very much that Dan Quayle was the best qualified person for that job. And as a matter of fact, I think for most people the notion of President Quayle is a very very troubling thought.LEHRER: John will ask a question of the Governor. It will be the last question and then the Vice President will have a rebuttal.MASHEK: Well, Governor, you did select Lloyd Bentsen of Texas.DUKAKIS: I did indeed.MASHEK: And you have a lot of disagreement with him on fundamental issues, including the Reagan tax cuts, aid to the rebels in Nicaragua, the death penalty, gun control. Who\\'s right?(Laughter)DUKAKIS: Well, John, I\\'m a man that\\'s been a chief executive for ten years. I\\'ve picked a lot of people. I\\'ve picked cabinets. I\\'ve named judges. I know that the people you pick make an enormous difference in your ability to govern and I set high standards. I try to meet them and I insist that people who work for me meet them, if they don\\'t, they don\\'t stick around very long.But I didn\\'t pick Lloyd Bentsen because he was a clone of Mike Dukakis. I picked him because he was somebody who would be a strong Vice President, somebody who would be an active Vice President. Somebody who would come to me if somebody came up with a crazy idea that we ought to trade arms to the Ayatollah for hostages and say, â‰¥Mr. President, that\\'s wrong. We shouldn\\'t do that.â‰¤ That\\'s the kind of Vice President I want.He, himself, has said, and rightly so, that he\\'ll be a strong Vice President. When the Vice President makes a decision, that will be his decision. And I\\'m very very proud of that choice. And I didn\\'t pick him because he agreed with me on everything.You know, Sam Rayburn once said that if two people agree on everything then only one person is doing the thinking. The fact is I\\'ve picked somebody who not only will be a great Vice President, but if, God forbid, something happens to the president, could step into that office and do so with distinction and with strength and with leadership. I doubt very much. I doubt very much that Mr. Bush\\'s selection for the Vice Presidency of the United States meets that test.(Applause)LEHRER: Mr. Vice President?BUSH: Well, I-we obviously have a difference. I believe it does meet the test. We\\'ll have an opportunity to see the two of them in action in a friendly forum, wonderful friendly fashion like this.(Laughter)BUSH: I had hoped this had been a little friendlier evening. I wanted to hitchhike a ride home in his tank with him. But now we\\'ve got the lines too carefully drawn here. But you talk about judgment. I mean, what kind of judgment-I mean, jumping all over the president on his decision on one area of farm policy. What kind of judgment sense has your chief education adviser now in jail in Massachusetts? I mean, there\\'s-I don\\'t think this is a fair argument. But nevertheless, I support my nominee for Vice President and he\\'ll do an outstanding job.LEHRER: Gentlemen, I was given some bad word a moment ago. There is time for one more question. Getting it in my ear and Ann Groer will ask it. Ann? To the Governor.GROER: Governor Dukakis, as many U.S. farmers face or undergo foreclosure, the United States is considering the possibility of forgiving a certain percentage of debt owed by Latin American and Third World countries, do you favor giving these countries a break in their loans and, if so, how do you explain that to the American farmers who are losing their land and livelihood?DUKAKIS: Well, I think we have to go to work on the problem of Third World debt and we\\'ve got to assist those Third World countries in dealing with this massive debt which they currently-which they have incurred and which is burdening them and which if we don\\'t do something about it and assist them along with other nations around the world, we\\'ll destroy their economies, destroy their future. And at the same time will destroy markets that are important to our farmers.But I also believe we need an agricultural policy which doesn\\'t cost us 15 to 20 to 25 billion dollars a year that it\\'s been costing us over the course of the past three or four years under this administration. I think it\\'s going to require good, solid credit policies. And thanks to the Congress we now have an agricultural credit bill which is helping and improving the situation with at least some of our farmers.I think it\\'s going to require a combination of supply management and reasonable price supports to make sure that our farmers get a decent price and I think it also is going to require an administration that understand that there are tremendous opportunities out there for the development of new uses for agricultural products, new uses which can help us to clean up our environment at the same time. Bio-degradable plastics-plastic-gasohol, which the Vice President has been involved in, road de-icers made from corn products. I mean, there are enormous opportunities out there to expand markets and to build a strong future for our farmers.But I don\\'t think there\\'s anything mutually exclusive or contradictory about building a strong farm economy in this country and assisting our family farms and providing a good strong future for rural communities and for rural America and at the same time working on Third World debt.As a matter of fact, Mexico, itself, is one of our biggest agricultural customers, so in the sense that we can work to help Mexico rebuild and expand and deal with these very serious economic problems we help our farmers at the same time.LEHRER: Mr. Vice President?BUSH: I oppose supply management and production controls. I support the farm bill, the 1985 farm bill and spending is moving in the right direction. I want to expand our markets abroad and that\\'s why I\\'ve called for that first economic summit to be on agriculture.I will not go back to the way the Democrats did it and used food as a political weapon and throw a grain embargo on the farmers in this country. I want to see rural redevelopment and I have been out front in favor of alternate sources of energy and one of them is gasohol and comes from using your corn and I think we can do better in terms of biodegradable for a lot of product, so I\\'m optimistic about the agricultural economy.In terms of the Third World, I support the Baker plan. I want to see market economies spring up all around the world and to the degree they do, we are succeeding. And I don\\'t want to see the banks let off the hook. I would oppose that, but I think were on the right track in agriculture and I am very very encouraged. But let\\'s not go back to that-what they call supply management and production control, that\\'ll simply price us out of the international market. Let\\'s try to expand our markets abroad.LEHRER: All right. That really is the end. Now, let\\'s go to closing statements. They will be two minutes each in duration by agreement. Vice President Bush goes first. Governor Dukakis second. Mr. Vice President.BUSH: I talked in New Orleans about a gentler and kinder nation and I have made specific proposals on education and the environment and on ethics and energy and how we do better in battling crime in our country. But there are two main focal points of this election. Opportunity and peace.I want to keep this expansion going. Yes, we want change but we are the change. I am the change. I don\\'t want to go back to malaise and misery index. And, so, opportunity. Keep America at work. The best poverty program is a job with dignity in the private sector. And in terms of peace, we are on the right track. We\\'ve achieved an arms control agreement that our critics thought was never possible and I want to build on it. I want to see us finalize that START agreement and I want it to be the one to finally lead the world to banishing chemical and biological weapons.I want to see asymmetrical reductions in conventional forces. And then it gets down to a question of values. We\\'ve had a chance to spell out our differences on the Pledge of Allegiance here tonight and on tough sentencing of drug king pins and this kind of thing. And I do favor the death penalty. And we\\'ve got a wide array of differences on those. But in the final analysis-in the final analysis, the person goes into that voting booth, they\\'re going to say, â‰¥Who has the values I believe in? Who has the experience that we trust? Who has the integrity and stability to get the job done?â‰¤ My fellow Americans, I am that man and I ask for your support. Thank you very much.(Applause)DUKAKIS: This has been an extraordinary 18 months for Kitty and me and for our family. We\\'ve had an opportunity to campaign all over this country and to meet with so many of you in communities and states and regions to get to know you. I\\'m more optimistic today than I was when I began about this nation providing we have the kind of leadership in Washington that can work with you, that can build partnerships, that can build jobs in every part of this country, not certain parts of this country.You know, my friends, my parents came to this country as immigrants like millions and millions of Americans before them and since, seeking opportunities, seeking the American dream. They made sure their sons understood that this was the greatest country in the world, that those of us especially who were the sons and daughters of immigrants had a special responsibility to give something to the country that had opened up its arms to our parents and given so much to them.I believe in the American dream. I\\'m a product of it and I want to help that dream come true for every single citizen in this land, with a good job and good wages, with good schools in every part of this country and every community in this country. With decent and affordable housing that our people can buy and own and live in, so that we end the shame of hopelessness in America. With decent and affordable healthcare for all working families.Yes, it\\'s a tough problem as Mr. Bush says, but itÏ€s not an insolvable problem. It\\'s one that we will solve and must solve, with a clean and wholesome environment and with a strong America that\\'s strong militarily and economically as we must be, an America that provides strong international leadership because we\\'re true to our values.We have an opportunity working together to build that future, to build a better America, to build a best America, because the best America doesn\\'t hide. We compete. The best America. We invest. The best America doesn\\'t leave some of its citizens behind. We live-we bring everybody along. And the best America is not behind us. The best America is yet to come. Thank you very much.(Applause)',\n",
       " 'October 7, 1984 Debate TranscriptOctober 7, 1984The First Reagan-Mondale Presidential DebateMS. RIDINGS: Good evening from the Kentucky Center for the Arts in Louisville, Kentucky. I\\'m Dorothy Ridings, president of the League of Women Voters, the sponsor of tonight\\'s first Presidential debate between Republican Ronald Reagan and Democrat Walter Mondale.Tonight\\'s debate marks the third consecutive Presidential election in which the League is presenting the candidates for the Nation\\'s highest office in face-to-face debate.Our panelists are James Wieghart, national political correspondent for Scripps-Howard News Service; Diane Sawyer, correspondent for the CBS program ``60 Minutes;\\'\\' and Fred Barnes, national political correspondent for the Baltimore Sun. Barbara Walters of ABC News, who is appearing in her fourth Presidential debate, is our moderator.Barbara.MS. WALTERS: Thank you, Dorothy.A few words as we begin tonight\\'s debate about the format. The position of the candidates -- that is, who answers questions first and who gives the last statement -- was determined by a toss of a coin between the two candidates. Mr. Mondale won, and that means that he chose to give the final closing statement. It means, too, that the President will answer the first question first. I hope that\\'s clear. If it isn\\'t, it will become clear as the debate goes on.Further, the candidates will be addressed as they each wanted and will, therefore, be called \"Mr. President\\'\\' and \"Mr. Mondale.\\'\\'Since there will also be a second debate between the two Presidential candidates, tonight will focus primarily on the economy and other domestic issues. The debate, itself, is built around questions from the panel. In each of its segments, a reporter will ask the candidates the same general question. Then -- and this is important -- each candidate will have the chance to rebut what the other has said. And the final segment of the debate will be the closing segment, and the candidates will each have 4 minutes for their closing statements. And as I have said, Mr. Mondale will be the last person on the program to speak.And now I would like to add a personal note if I may. As Dorothy Ridings pointed out, I have been involved now in four Presidential debates, either as a moderator or as a panelist. In the past, there was no problem in selecting panelists. Tonight, however, there were to have been four panelists participating in this debate.The candidates were given a list of almost 100 qualified journalists from all the media and could agree on only these three fine journalists. As moderator, and on behalf of my fellow journalists, I very much regret, as does the League of Women Voters, that this situation has occurred.And now let us begin the debate with the first question from James Wieghart.Mr. Wieghart.The Nation\\'s EconomyMR. WIEGHART: Mr. President, in 1980 you promised the American people -- in your campaign -- a balanced budget by 1983. We\\'ve now had more and bigger deficits in the 4 years you\\'ve been in office. Mr. President, do you have a secret plan to balance the budget sometime in a second term, and if so, would you lay out that plan for us tonight?The President. I have a plan -- not a secret plan. As a matter of fact, it is the economic recovery program that we presented when I took office in 1981.It is true that earlier, working with some very prominent economists, I had come up, during the campaign, with an economic program that I thought could rectify the great problems confronting us -- the double-digit inflation, the high tax rates that I think were hurting the economy, the stagflation that we were undergoing. Before even the election day, something that none of those economists had even predicted had happened, that the economy was so worsened that I was openly saying that what we had thought on the basis of our plan could have brought a balanced budget -- no, that was no longer possible.So, the plan that we have had and that we are following is a plan that is based on growth in the economy, recovery without inflation, and reducing the share that the Government is taking from the gross national product, which has become a drag on the economy.Already, we have a recovery that has been going on for about 21 months to the point that we can now call it an expansion. Under that, this year, we have seen a $21 billion reduction in the deficit from last year, based mainly on the increased revenues the Government is getting without raising tax rates.Our tax cut, we think, was very instrumental in bringing about this economic recovery. We have reduced inflation to about a third of what it was. The interest rates have come down about 9 or 10 points and, we think, must come down further. In the last 21 months, more than 6 million people have gotten jobs -- there have been created new jobs for those people to where there are now 105 million civilians working, where there were only 99 million before; 107, if you count the military.So, we believe that as we continue to reduce the level of government spending -- the increase, rate of increase in government spending, which has come down from 17 to 6 percent, and, at the same time, as the growth in the economy increases the revenues the Government gets, without raising taxes, those two lines will meet. And when they meet, that is a balanced budget.MR. WIEGHART: Mr. President, the Congressional Budget Office has some bad news. The lines aren\\'t about to meet, according to their projections. They project that the budget deficit will continue to climb. In the year 1989 they project a budget deficit of $273 billion.In view of that, and in view of the economic recovery we are now enjoying, would it make sense to propose a tax increase or take some other fiscal measures to reduce that deficit now, when times are relatively good?The President. The deficit is the result of excessive government spending. I do not, very frankly, take seriously the Congressional Budget Office projections, because they have been wrong on virtually all of them, including the fact that our recovery wasn\\'t going to take place to begin with. But it has taken place.But, as I said, we have the rate of increase in government spending down to 6 percent. If the rate of increase in government spending can be held at 5 percent -- we\\'re not far from there -- by 1989 that would have reduced the budget deficits down to a $30 or $40 billion level. At the same time, if we can have a 4-percent recovery continue through that same period of time, that will mean -- without an increase in tax rates -- that will mean $400 billion more in government revenues. And so, I think that the lines can meet.Actually, in constant dollars, in the domestic side of the budget, there has been no spending increase in the 4 years that we have been here.MR. WIEGHART: Mr. Mondale, the Carter-Mondale administration didn\\'t come close to balancing the budget in its 4 years in office either, despite the fact that President Carter did promise a balanced budget during his term.You have proposed a plan combining tax increases and budgetary cuts and other changes in the administration of the Government that would reduce the projected budget deficit by two-thirds, to approximately $87 billion in 1989. That still is an enormous deficit that will be running for these 4 years. What other steps do you think should be taken to reduce this deficit and position the country for economic growth?MR. MONDALE: One of the key tests of leadership is whether one sees clearly the nature of the problems confronted by our nation. And perhaps the dominant domestic issue of our times is what do we do about these enormous deficits.I respect the President; I respect the Presidency, and I think he knows that. But the fact of it is, every estimate by this administration about the size of the deficit has been off by billions and billions of dollars. As a matter of fact, over 4 years, they\\'ve missed the mark by nearly $600 billion. We were told we would have a balanced budget in 1983. It was $200 billion deficit instead. And now we have a major question facing the American people as to whether we\\'ll deal with this deficit and get it down for the sake of a healthy recovery.Virtually every economic analysis that I\\'ve heard of, including the distinguished Congressional Budget Office, which is respected by, I think, almost everyone, says that even with historically high levels of economic growth, we will suffer a $263 billion deficit. In other words, it doesn\\'t converge as the President suggests. It gets larger even with growth.What that means is that we will continue to have devastating problems with foreign trade. This is the worst trade year in American history by far. Our rural and farm friends will have continued devastation. Real interest rates -- the real cost of interest -- will remain very, very high, and many economists are predicting that we\\'re moving into a period of very slow growth because the economy is tapering off and may be a recession. I get it down to a level below 2 percent of gross national product with a policy that\\'s fair. I\\'ve stood up and told the American people that I think it\\'s a real problem, that it can destroy long-term economic growth, and I\\'ve told you what I think should be done.I think this is a test of leadership, and I think the American people know the difference.MR. WIEGHART: Mr. Mondale, one other way to attack the deficit is further reductions in spending. The President has submitted a number of proposals to Congress to do just that, and in many instances the House, controlled by the Democrats, has opposed them. Isn\\'t it one aspect of leadership for prominent Democrats such as yourself to encourage responsible reductions in spending, and thereby reduce the deficit?MR. MONDALE: Absolutely, and I proposed over a hundred billion dollars in cuts in Federal spending over 4 years, but I am not going to cut it out of Social Security and Medicare and student assistance and things -- [applause] -- that people need. These people depend upon all of us for the little security that they have, and I\\'m not going to do it that way.The rate of defense spending increase can be slowed. Certainly we can find a coffeepot that costs something less than $7,000. And there are other ways of squeezing this budget without constantly picking on our senior citizens and the most vulnerable in American life. And that\\'s why the Congress, including the Republicans, have not gone along with the President\\'s recommendations.MS. WALTERS: I would like to ask the audience please to refrain from applauding either side; it just takes away from the time for your candidates.And now it is time for the rebuttal. Mr. President, 1 minute for rebuttal.THE PRESIDENT: Yes. I don\\'t believe that Mr. Mondale has a plan for balancing the budget; he has a plan for raising taxes. And, as a matter of fact, the biggest single tax increase in our nation\\'s history took place 1977. And for the 5 years previous to our taking office, taxes doubled in the United States, and the budgets increased $318 billion. So, there is no ratio between taxing and balancing a budget. Whether you borrow the money or whether you simply tax it away from the people, you\\'re taking the same amount of money out of the private sector, unless and until you bring down government\\'s share of what it is taking.With regard to Social Security, I hope there\\'ll be more time than just this minute to mention that, but I will say this: A President should never say \"never.\\'\\' But I\\'m going to violate that rule and say \"never.\\'\\' I will never stand for a reduction of the Social Security benefits to the people that are now getting them.MS. WALTERS: Mr. Mondale?MR. MONDALE: Well, that\\'s exactly the commitment that was made to the American people in 1980: He would never reduce benefits. And of course, what happened right after the election is they proposed to cut Social Security benefits by 25 percent -- reducing the adjustment for inflation, cutting out minimum benefits for the poorest on Social Security, removing educational benefits for dependents whose widows were trying -- with widows trying to get them through college. Everybody remembers that; people know what happened.There\\'s a difference. I have fought for Social Security and Medicare and for things to help people who are vulnerable all my life, and I will do it as President of the United States.MS. WALTERS: Thank you very much. We\\'ll now begin with segment number two with my colleague, Diane Sawyer.Ms. Sawyer?Leadership QualitiesMS. SAWYER: Mr. President, Mr. Mondale, the public opinion polls do suggest that the American people are most concerned about the personal leadership characteristics of the two candidates, and each of you has questioned the other\\'s leadership ability. Mr. President, you have said that Mr. Mondale\\'s leadership would take the country down the path of defeatism and despair, and Vice President Bush has called him whining and hoping for bad news. And, Mr. Mondale, you have said that President Reagan offers showmanship, not leadership, that he has not mastered what he must know to command his government.I\\'d like to ask each of you to substantiate your claims -- Mr. Mondale first. Give us specifics to support your claim that President Reagan is a showman, not a leader; has not mastered what he must know to be President after 4 years, and then, second, tell us what personal leadership characteristics you have that he does not.MR. MONDALE: Well, first of all, I think the first answer this evening suggests exactly what I\\'m saying. There is no question that we face this massive deficit, and almost everybody agrees unless we get it down, the chances for long-term, healthy growth are nil. And it\\'s also unfair to dump these tremendous bills on our children.The President says it will disappear overnight because of some reason. No one else believes that\\'s the case. I do, and I\\'m standing up to the issue with an answer that\\'s fair. I think that\\'s what leadership is all about. There\\'s a difference between being a quarterback and a cheerleader, and when there\\'s a real problem, a President must confront it.What I was referring to, of course, in the comment that you referred to was the situation in Lebanon. Now, for three occasions, one after another, our Embassies were assaulted in the same way by a truck with demolitions. The first time -- and I did not criticize the President, because these things can happen -- once, and sometimes twice -- the second time the barracks in Lebanon were assaulted, as we all remember. There was two or three commission reports, recommendations by the CIA, the State Department, and the others, and the third time there was even a warning from the terrorists themselves.Now, I believe that a President must command that White House and those who work for him. It\\'s the toughest job on Earth, and you must master the facts and insist that things that must be done are done. I believe that the way in which I will approach the Presidency is what\\'s needed, because all my life that has been the way in which I have sought to lead. And that\\'s why in this campaign I\\'m telling you exactly what I want to do. I am answering your questions. I am trying to provide leadership now, before the election, so that the American people can participate in that decision.MS. SAWYER: You have said, Mr. Mondale, that the polls have given you lower ratings on leadership than President Reagan because your message has failed to get through. Given that you have been in public office for so many years, what accounts for the failure of your message to get through?MR. MONDALE: Well, I think we\\'re getting better all the time. And I think tonight, as we contrast for the first time our differing approach to government, to values, to the leadership in this country, I think as this debate goes forward, the American people will have for the first time a chance to weigh the two of us against each other. And I think, as a part of that process, what I am trying to say will come across, and that is that we must lead, we must command, we must direct, and a President must see it like it is. He must stand for the values of decency that the American people stand for, and he must use the power of the White House to try to control these nuclear weapons and lead this world toward a safer world.MS. SAWYER: Mr. President, the issue is leadership in personal terms. First, do you think, as Vice President Bush said, that Mr. Mondale\\'s campaign is one of whining and hoping for bad news? And second, what leadership characteristics do you possess that Mr. Mondale does not?THE PRESIDENT: Well, whether he does or not, let me suggest my own idea about the leadership factor, since you\\'ve asked it. And, incidentally, I might say that with regard to the 25-percent cut in Social Security -- before I get to the answer to your question -- the only 25-percent cut that I know of was accompanying that huge 1977 tax increase, was a cut of 25 percent in the benefits for every American who was born after 1916.Now, leadership. First of all, I think you must have some principles you believe in. In mine, I happen to believe in the people and believe that the people are supposed to be dominant in our society -- that they, not government, are to have control of their own affairs to the greatest extent possible, with an orderly society.Now, having that, I think also that in leadership -- well, I believe that you find people, positions such as I\\'m in who have the talent and ability to do the things that are needed in the various departments of government. I don\\'t believe that a leader should be spending his time in the Oval Office deciding who\\'s going to play tennis on the White House court. And you let those people go with the guidelines of overall policy, not looking over their shoulder and nitpicking the manner in which they go at the job. You are ultimately responsible, however, for that job.But I also believe something else about that. I believe that -- and when I became Governor of California, I started this, and I continue it in this office -- that any issue that comes before me, I have instructed Cabinet members and staff they are not to bring up any of the political ramifications that might surround the issue. I don\\'t want to hear them. I want to hear only arguments as to whether it is good or bad for the people -- is it morally right? And on that basis and that basis alone, we make a decision on every issue.Now, with regard to my feeling about why I thought that his record bespoke his possible taking us back to the same things that we knew under the previous administration, his record is that he spoke in praise of deficits several times, said they weren\\'t to be abhorred -- that, as a matter of fact, he at one time said he wished the deficit could be doubled, because they stimulate the economy and helped reduce unemployment.MS. SAWYER: As a followup, let me draw in another specific, if I could -- a specific that the Democrats have claimed about your campaign -- that it is essentially based on imagery. And one specific that they allege is that, for instance, recently you showed up at the opening ceremony of a Buffalo old-age housing project, when in fact, your policy was to cut Federal housing subsidies for the elderly. Yet you were there to have your picture taken with them.THE PRESIDENT: Our policy was not to cut subsidies. We have believed in partnership, and that was an example of a partnership between, not only local government and the Federal Government but also between the private sector that built that particular structure. And this is what we\\'ve been trying to do, is involve the Federal Government in such partnerships.We are today subsidizing housing for more than 10 million people, and we\\'re going to continue along that line. We have no thought of throwing people out into the snow, whether because of age or need. We have preserved the safety net for the people with true need in this country, and it has been pure demagoguery that we have in some way shut off all the charitable programs or many of them for the people who have real need. The safety net is there, and we\\'re taking care of more people than has ever been taken care of before by any administration in this country.MS. WALTERS: Mr. Mondale, an opportunity for you to rebut.MR. MONDALE: Well, I guess I\\'m reminded a little bit of what Will Rogers once said about Hoover. He said, \"It\\'s not what he doesn\\'t know that bothers me; it\\'s what he knows for sure that just ain\\'t so.\\'\\' [Laughter] The fact of it is: The President\\'s budget sought to cut Social Security by 25 percent. It\\'s not an opinion; it\\'s a fact. And when the President was asked the other day, \"What do you want to cut in the budget?\\'\\', he said, \"Cut those things I asked for but didn\\'t get.\\'\\' That\\'s Social Security and Medicare.The second fact is that the housing unit for senior citizens that the President dedicated in Buffalo was only made possible through a Federal assistance program for senior citizens that the President\\'s budget sought to terminate. So, if he\\'d had his way, there wouldn\\'t have been any housing project there at all. This administration has taken a meat cleaver out, in terms of Federal-assisted housing, and the record is there. We have to see the facts before we can draw conclusions.MS. WALTERS: Mr. President?THE PRESIDENT: Well, let me just respond with regard to Social Security. When we took office, we discovered that the program that the Carter-Mondale administration had said would solve the fiscal problems of Social Security for the next 50 years wouldn\\'t solve them for 5. Social Security was due to go bankrupt before 1983.Any proposals that I made at that time were at the request of the chairman, a Democrat, of one of the leading committees, who said we have to do something before the program goes broke and the checks bounce. And so, we made a proposal. And then in 1982, they used that proposal in a demagogic fashion for the 1982 campaign. And 3 days after the election in 1982, they came to us and said, Social Security, we know, is broke. Indeed, we had to borrow $17 billion to pay the checks. And then I asked for a bipartisan commission, which I\\'d asked for from the beginning, to sit down and work out a solution.And so, the whole matter of what to do with Social Security has been resolved by bipartisan legislation, and it is on a sound basis now for as far as you can see into the next century.MS. WALTERS: Mr. President, we begin segment number three with Fred Barnes.ReligionMR. BARNES: Mr. President, would you describe your religious beliefs, noting particularly whether you consider yourself a born-again Christian, and explain how these beliefs affect your Presidential decisions?THE PRESIDENT: Well, I was raised to have a faith and a belief and have been a member of a church since I was a small boy. In our particular church, we did not use that term, \"born again,\\'\\' so I don\\'t know whether I would fit that -- that particular term. But I have -- thanks to my mother, God rest her soul -- the firmest possible belief and faith in God. And I don\\'t believe -- I believe, I should say, as Lincoln once said, that I could not -- I would be the most stupid man in the world if I thought I could confront the duties of the office I hold if I could not turn to someone who was stronger and greater than all others. And I do resort to prayer.At the same time, however, I have not believed that prayer should be introduced into an election or be a part of a political campaign -- or religion a part of that campaign. As a matter of fact, I think religion became a part of this campaign when Mr. Mondale\\'s running mate said I wasn\\'t a good Christian.So, it does play a part in my life. I have no hesitancy in saying so. And, as I say, I don\\'t believe that I could carry on unless I had a belief in a higher authority and a belief that prayers are answered.MR. BARNES: Given those beliefs, Mr. President, why don\\'t you attend services regularly, either by going to church or by inviting a minister to the White House, as President Nixon used to do, or someone to Camp David, as President Carter used to do?THE PRESIDENT: The answer to your question is very simple about why I don\\'t go to church. I have gone to church regularly all my life, and I started to here in Washington. And now, in the position I hold and in the world in which we live, where Embassies do get blown up in Beirut -- we\\'re supposed to talk about that on the debate the 21st, I understand -- but I pose a threat to several hundred people if I go to church.I know the threats that are made against me. We all know the possibility of terrorism. We have seen the barricades that have had to be built around the White House. And, therefore, I don\\'t feel -- and my minister knows this and supports me in this position -- I don\\'t feel that I have a right to go to church, knowing that my being there could cause something of the kind that we have seen in other places, in Beirut, for example. And I miss going to church, but I think the Lord understands. [Applause]MS. WALTERS: May I ask you, please -- [applause] -- may I ask the audience please to refrain from applause.Fred, your second question.MR. BARNES: Mr. Mondale, would you describe your religious beliefs and mention whether you consider yourself a born-again Christian, and explain how those beliefs would affect your decisions as President?MR. MONDALE: First of all, I accept President Reagan\\'s affirmation of faith. I\\'m sure that we all accept and admire his commitment to his faith, and we are strengthened, all of us, by that fact.I am a son of a Methodist minister. My wife is the daughter of a Presbyterian minister. And I don\\'t know if I\\'ve been born again, but I know I was born into a Christian family. And I believe I have sung at more weddings and more funerals than anybody ever to seek the Presidency. Whether that helps or not, I don\\'t know.I have a deep religious faith. Our family does. It is fundamental. It\\'s probably the reason that I\\'m in politics. I think our faith tells us, instructs us, about the moral life that we should lead. And I think we\\'re all together on that.What bothers me is this growing tendency to try to use one\\'s own personal interpretation of faith politically, to question others\\' faith, and to try to use the instrumentalities of government to impose those views on others. All history tells us that that\\'s a mistake.When the Republican platform says that from here on out, we\\'re going to have a religious test for judges before they\\'re selected for the Federal court, and then Jerry Falwell announces that that means they get at least two Justices of the Supreme Court, I think that\\'s an abuse of faith in our country.This nation is the most religious nation on Earth -- more people go to church and synagogues than any other nation on Earth -- and it\\'s because we kept the politicians and the state out of the personal exercise of our faith. That\\'s why faith in the United States is pure and unpolluted by the intervention of politicians. And I think if we want to continue -- as I do -- to have a religious nation, lets keep that line and never cross it.MS. WALTERS: Thank you. Mr. Barnes, next question. We have time for rebuttal now.MR. BARNES: I think I have a followup.MS. WALTERS: Yes, I asked you if you did. I\\'m sorry -- --MR. BARNES: Yes, I do.MS. WALTERS: -- -- I thought you waived it.MR. BARNES: Yes, Mr. Mondale, you\\'ve complained, just now, about Jerry Falwell, and you\\'ve complained other times about other fundamentalists in politics. Correct me if I\\'m wrong, but I don\\'t recall your ever complaining about ministers who are involved in the civil rights movement or in the anti-Vietnam war demonstrations or about black preachers who\\'ve been so involved in American politics. Is it only conservative ministers that you object to?MR. MONDALE: No. What I object to -- [applause] -- what I object to -- what I object to is someone seeking to use his faith to question the faith of another or to use that faith and seek to use the power of government to impose it on others.A minister who is in civil rights or in the conservative movement, because he believes his faith instructs him to do that, I admire. The fact that the faith speaks to us and that we are moral people, hopefully, I accept and rejoice in. It\\'s when you try to use that to undermine the integrity of private political -- or private religious faith and the use of the state is where -- for the most personal decisions in American life -- that\\'s where I draw the line.MS. WALTERS: Thank you. Now, Mr. President, rebuttal.THE PRESIDENT: Yes, it\\'s very difficult to rebut, because I find myself in so much agreement with Mr. Mondale. I, too, want that wall that is in the Constitution of separation of church and state to remain there. The only attacks I have made are on people who apparently would break away at that wall from the government side, using the government, using the power of the courts and so forth to hinder that part of the Constitution that says the government shall not only not establish a religion, it shall not inhibit the practice of religion. And they have been using these things to have government, through court orders, inhibit the practice of religion. A child wants to say grace in a school cafeteria and a court rules that they can\\'t do it because it\\'s school property. These are they types of things that I think have been happening in a kind of a secular way that have been eroding that separation, and I am opposed to that.With regard to a platform on the Supreme Court, I can only say one thing about that. I have appointed one member to the Supreme Court: Sandra Day O\\'Connor. I\\'ll stand on my record on that. And if I have the opportunity to appoint any more, I\\'ll do it in the same manner that I did in selecting her.MS. WALTERS: Mr. Mondale, your rebuttal, please.MR. MONDALE: The platform to which the President refers, in fact, calls for a religious test in the selection of judges. And Jerry Falwell says that means we get two or three judges. And it would involve a religious test for the first time in American life.Let\\'s take the example that the President cites. I believe in prayer. My family prays. We\\'ve never had any difficulty finding time to pray. But do we want a constitutional amendment adopted of the kind proposed by the President that gets the local politicians into the business of selecting prayers that our children must either recite in school or be embarrassed and asked to excuse themselves? Who would write the prayer? What would it say? How would it be resolved when those disputes occur?It seems to me that a moment\\'s reflection tells you why the United States Senate turned that amendment down, because it will undermine the practice of honest faith in our country by politicizing it. We don\\'t want that.MS. WALTERS: Thank you, Mr. Mondale. Our time is up for this round.We go into the second round of our questioning, begin again with Jim Wieghart.Jim?Political IssuesMR. WIEGHART: After that discussion, this may be like going from the sublime to the ridiculous, but here goes. I have a political question for you, Mr. Mondale. [Laughter]Polls indicate a massive change in the electorate, away from the coalition that has long made the Democratic Party a majority. Blue-collar workers, young professionals, their children, and much of the middle class now regard themselves as Independents or Republican instead of Democrats, and the gap -- the edge the Democrats had in party registration seems to be narrowing.I\\'d like to ask you, Mr. Mondale, what is causing this? Is the Democratic Party out of sync with the majority of Americans? And will it soon be replaced as the majority party by the Republicans? What do you think needs to be done about it, as a Democrat?MR. MONDALE: My answer is that this campaign isn\\'t over yet. And when people vote, I think you\\'re going to see a very strong verdict by the American people that they favor the approach that I\\'m talking about.The American people want arms control. They don\\'t want this arms race. And they don\\'t want this deadly new effort to bring weapons into the heavens. And they want an American foreign policy that leads toward a safer world.The American people see this debt, and they know it\\'s got to come down. And if it won\\'t come down, the economy\\'s going to slow down, maybe go into a recession. They see this tremendous influx and swamping of cheap foreign imports in this country that has cost over 3 million jobs, given farmers the worst year in American history. And they know this debt must come down as well, because it\\'s unfair to our children.The American people want this environment protected. They know that these toxic waste dumps should have been cleaned up a long time ago, and they know that people\\'s lives and health are being risked, because we\\'ve had an administration that has been totally insensitive to the law and the demand for the protection of the environment.The American people want their children educated. They want to get our edge back in science, and they want a policy headed by the President that helps close this gap that\\'s widening between the United States and Europe and Japan.The American people want to keep opening doors. They want those civil rights laws enforced. They want the equal rights amendment ratified. They want equal pay for comparable effort for women. And they want it because they\\'ve understood from the beginning that when we open doors, we\\'re all stronger, just as we were at the Olympics.I think as you make the case, the American people will increasingly come to our cause.MR. WIEGHART: Mr. Mondale, isn\\'t it possible that the American people have heard your message -- and they are listening -- but they are rejecting it?MR. MONDALE: Well, tonight we had the first debate over the deficit. The President says it\\'ll disappear automatically. I\\'ve said it\\'s going to take some work. I think the American people will draw their own conclusions.Secondly, I\\'ve said that I will not support the cuts in Social Security and Medicare and the rest that the President has proposed. The President answers that it didn\\'t happen or, if it did, it was resolved later in a commission. As the record develops, I think it\\'s going to become increasingly clear that what I am saying and where I want to take this country is exactly where the country wants to go, and the comparison of approaches is such that I think will lead to further strength.MR. WIEGHART: Mr. President, you and your party are benefiting from what appears to be an erosion of the old Democratic coalition, but you have not laid out a specific agenda to take this shift beyond November 6th. What is your program for America for the next decade, with some specificity?THE PRESIDENT: Well, again, I\\'m running on the record. I think sometimes Mr. Mondale\\'s running away from his. But I\\'m running on the record of what we have asked for. We\\'ll continue to try to get things that we didn\\'t get in a program that has already brought the rate of spending of government down from 17 percent to 6.1 percent, a program of returning authority and autonomy to the local and State governments that has been unjustly seized by the Federal Government. And you might find those words in a Democratic platform of some years ago -- I know, because I was a Democrat at that time. And I left the party eventually, because I could no longer follow the turn in the Democratic leadership that took us down an entirely different path, a path of centralizing authority in the Federal Government, lacking trust in the American people.I promised, when we took office, that we would reduce inflation. We have, to one-third of what it was. I promised that we would reduce taxes. We did, 25 percent across the board. That barely held even with -- if it did that much -- with the gigantic tax increase imposed in 1977. But at least it took that burden away from them.I said that we would create jobs for our people, and we did -- 6 million in the last 20 or 21 months. I said that we would become respected in the world once again and that we would refurbish our national defense to the place that we could deal on the world scene and then seek disarmament, reduction of arms, and, hopefully, an elimination of nuclear weapons. We have done that.All of the things that I said we would do, from inflation being down, interest rates being down, unemployment falling, all of those things we have done. And I think this is something the American people see.I think they also know that we had a commission that came in a year ago with a recommendation on education -- on excellence in education. And today, without the Federal Government being involved other than passing on to them, the school districts, the words from that commission, we find 35 States with task forces now dealing with their educational problems. We find that schools are extending the curriculum to now have forced teaching of mathematics and science and so forth. All of these things have brought an improvement in the college entrance exams for the first time in some 20 years.So, I think that many Democrats are seeing the same thing this Democrat saw: The leadership isn\\'t taking us where we want to go.MR. WIEGHART: Mr. President, much of what you said affects the quality of life of many Americans -- their income, the way they live, and so forth -- but there\\'s an aspect to quality of life that lies beyond the private sector which has to do with our neighborhoods, our cities, our streets, our parks, our environment. In those areas, I have difficulty seeing what your program is and what you feel the Federal responsibility is in these areas of the quality of life in the public sector that affects everybody, and even enormous wealth by one individual can\\'t create the kind of environment that he might like.THE PRESIDENT: There are tasks that government legitimately should enforce and tasks that government performs well, and you\\'ve named some of them. Crime has come down the last 2 years, for the first time in many, many decades that it has come down -- or since we\\'ve kept records -- 2 consecutive years, and last year it came down the biggest drop in crime that we\\'ve had. I think that we\\'ve had something to do with that, just as we have with the drug problem nationwide.The environment? Yes, I feel as strongly as anyone about the preservation of the environment. When we took office, we found that the national parks were so dirty and contained so many hazards, lack of safety features, that we stopped buying additional park land until we had rectified this with what was to be a 5-year program -- but it\\'s just about finished already -- a billion dollars. And now we\\'re going back to budgeting for additional lands for our parks. We have added millions of acres to the wilderness lands, to the game refuges. I think that we\\'re out in front of most -- and I see that the red light is blinking, so I can\\'t continue. But I\\'ve got more.MS. WALTERS: Well, you\\'ll have a chance when your rebuttal time comes up, perhaps, Mr. President. Mr. Mondale, now it\\'s your turn for rebuttal.MR. MONDALE: The President says that when the Democratic Party made its turn, he left it. The year that he decided we had lost our way was the year that John F. Kennedy was running against Richard Nixon. I was chairman of \"Minnesotans for Kennedy;\\'\\' President Reagan was chairman of a thing called \"Democrats for Nixon.\\'\\' Now, maybe we made a wrong turn with Kennedy, but I\\'ll be proud of supporting him all of my life. And I\\'m very happy that John Kennedy was elected, because John Kennedy looked at the future with courage, saw what needed to be done, and understood his own government.The President just said that his government is shrinking. It\\'s not. It\\'s now the largest peacetime government ever in terms of the take from the total economy. And instead of retreating -- instead of being strong where we should be strong, he wants to make it strong and intervene in the most private and personal questions in American life. That\\'s where government should not be.MS. WALTERS: Mr. President?THE PRESIDENT: Before I campaigned as a Democrat for a Republican candidate for President, I had already voted for Dwight Eisenhower to be President of the United States. And so, my change had come earlier than that. I hadn\\'t gotten around to reregistering as yet. I found that was rather difficult to do. But I finally did it.There are some other things that have been said here -- back, and you said that I might be able to dredge them up. Mr. Mondale referred to the farmers\\' worst year. The farmers are not the victims of anything this administration has done. The farmers were the victims of the double-digit inflation and the 21\\\\1/2\\\\-percent interest rates of the Carter-Mondale administration and the grain embargo, which destroyed our reliability nationwide as a supplier. All of these things are presently being rectified, and I think that we are going to salvage the farmers. As a matter of fact, there has been less than one-quarter of 1 percent of foreclosures of the 270,000 loans from government that the farmers have.MS. WALTERS: Thank you, Mr. President. We\\'ll now turn to Diane Sawyer for her round of questions.Diane?AbortionMS. SAWYER: I\\'d like to turn to an area that I think few people enjoy discussing, but that we probably should tonight because the positions of the two candidates are so clearly different and lead to very different policy consequences -- and that is abortion and right to life. I\\'m exploring for your personal views of abortion and specifically how you would want them applied as public policy.First, Mr. President. Do you consider abortion murder or a sin? And second, how hard would you work -- what kind of priority would you give in your second term legislation to make abortion illegal? And specifically, would you make certain, as your party platform urges, that Federal justices that you appoint be prolife?THE PRESIDENT: I have believed that in the appointment of judges that all that was specified in the party platform was that they respect the sanctity of human life. Now, that I would want to see in any judge and with regard to any issue having to do with human life. But with regard to abortion, and I have a feeling that this is -- there\\'s been some reference without naming it here in the remarks of Mr. Mondale tied to injecting religion into government. With me, abortion is not a problem of religion, it\\'s a problem of the Constitution.I believe that until and unless someone can establish that the unborn child is not a living human being, then that child is already protected by the Constitution, which guarantees life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness to all of us. And I think that this is what we should concentrate on, is trying -- I know there were weeks and weeks of testimony before a Senate committee, there were medical authorities, there were religious -- there were clerics there -- everyone talking about this matter of prolife. And at the end of all of that, not one shred of evidence was introduced that the unborn child was not alive. We have seen premature births that are now grown-up, happy people going around.Also, there is a strange dichotomy in this whole position about our courts ruling that abortion is not the taking of a human life. In California, sometime ago, a man beat a woman so savagely that her unborn child was born dead with a fractured skull, and the California State Legislature unanimously passed a law that was signed by the then-Democratic Governor -- signed a law that said that any man who so abuses a pregnant woman that he causes the death of her unborn child shall be charged with murder. Now, isn\\'t it strange that that same woman could have taken the life of her unborn child, and it was abortion and not murder, but if somebody else does it, that\\'s murder? And it used the term \"death of the unborn child.\\'\\'So, this has been my feeling about abortion, that we have a problem now to determine -- and all the evidence so far comes down on the side of the unborn child being a living human being.MS. SAWYER: A two-part followup. Do I take it from what you\\'ve said about the platform, then, that you don\\'t regard the language and don\\'t regard in your own appointments, abortion position a test of any kind for justices -- that it should be? And also, if abortion is made illegal, how would you want it enforced? Who would be the policing units that would investigate? And would you want the women who have abortions to be prosecuted?THE PRESIDENT: The laws regarding that always were State laws. It was only when the Supreme Court handed down a decision that the Federal Government intervened in what had always been a State policy. Our laws against murder are State laws. So, I would think that this would be the point of enforcement on this.As I say, I feel that we have a problem here to resolve. And no one has approached it from that matter. It does not happen that the church that I belong to had that as part of its dogma. I know that some churches do.Now, it is a sin if you\\'re taking a human life. At the same time, in our Judeo-Christian tradition, we recognize the right of taking a human life in self-defense. And therefore, I\\'ve always believed that a mother, if medically it is determined that her life is at risk if she goes through with the pregnancy, she has a right then to take the life of even her own unborn child in defense of her own.MS. SAWYER: Mr. Mondale, to turn to you, do you consider abortion a murder or a sin? And bridging from what President Reagan said, he has written that if society doesn\\'t know whether life does -- human life, in fact, does begin at conception, as long as there is a doubt, that the unborn child should at least be given the benefit of the doubt and that there should be protection for that unborn child.MR. MONDALE: This is one of the most emotional and difficult issues that could possibly be debated. I think your questions, however, underscore the fact there is probably no way that government should or could answer this question in every individual case and in the private lives of the American people.The constitutional amendment proposed by President Reagan would make it a crime for a woman to have an abortion if she had been raped or suffered from incest. Is it really the view of the American people, however you feel on the question of abortion, that government ought to be reaching into your livingrooms and making choices like this? I think it cannot work, won\\'t work, and will lead to all kinds of cynical evasions of the law. Those who can afford to have them will continue to have them. The disadvantaged will go out in the back alley as they used to do.I think these questions are inherently personal and moral, and every individual instance is different. Every American should be aware of the seriousness of the step. But there are some things that government can do and some things they cannot do.Now, the example that the President cites has nothing to do with abortion. Somebody went to a woman and nearly killed her. That\\'s always been a serious crime and always should be a serious crime. But how does that compare with the problem of a woman who is raped? Do we really want those decisions made by judges who\\'ve been picked because they will agree to find the person guilty? I don\\'t think so, and I think it\\'s going in exactly the wrong direction.In America, on basic moral questions we have always let the people decide in their own personal lives. We haven\\'t felt so insecure that we\\'ve reached for the club of state to have our point of view. It\\'s been a good instinct. And we\\'re the most religious people on Earth.One final point: President Reagan, as Governor of California, signed a bill which is perhaps the most liberal proabortion bill of any State in the Union.MS. SAWYER: But if I can get you back for a moment on my point, which was the question of when human life begins -- a two-part followup. First of all, at what point do you believe that human life begins in the growth of a fetus? And second of all, you said that government shouldn\\'t be involved in the decisions. Yet there are those who would say that government is involved, and the consequence of the involvement was 1.5 million abortions in 1980. And how do you feel about that?MR. MONDALE: The basic decision of the Supreme Court is that each person has to make this judgment in her own life, and that\\'s the way it\\'s been done. And it\\'s a personal and private, moral judgment. I don\\'t know the answer to when life begins. And it\\'s not that simple, either. You\\'ve got another life involved. And if it\\'s rape, how do you draw moral judgments on that? If it\\'s incest, how do you draw moral judgments on that? Does every woman in America have to present herself before some judge picked by Jerry Falwell to clear her personal judgment? It won\\'t work. [Applause]MS. WALTERS: I\\'m sorry to do this, but I really must talk to the audience.You\\'re all invited guests. I know I\\'m wasting time in talking to you, but it really is very unfair of you to applaud -- sometimes louder, less loud -- and I ask you, as people who were invited here, and polite people, to refrain.We have our time now for rebuttal. Mr. President.THE PRESIDENT: Yes. Well, with regard to this being a personal choice, isn\\'t that what a murderer is insisting on, his or her right to kill someone because of whatever fault they think justifies that?Now, I\\'m not capable, and I don\\'t think you are, any of us, to make this determination that must be made with regard to human life. I am simply saying that I believe that that\\'s where the effort should be directed -- to make that determination.I don\\'t think that any of us should be called upon here to stand and make a decision as to what other things might come under the self-defense tradition. That, too, would have to be worked out then, when you once recognize that we\\'re talking about a life. But in this great society of ours, wouldn\\'t it make a lot more sense, in this gentle and kind society, if we had a program that made it possible for when incidents come along in which someone feels they must do away with that unborn child, that instead we make it available for the adoption? There are a million and a half people out there standing in line waiting to adopt children who can\\'t have them any other way.MS. WALTERS: Mr. Mondale.MR. MONDALE: I agree with that, and that\\'s why I was a principal sponsor of a liberal adoption law, so that more of these children could come to term, so that the young mothers were educated, so we found an option, an alternative. I\\'m all for that. But the question is whether this other option proposed by the President should be pursued. And I don\\'t agree with it.Since I\\'ve got about 20 seconds, let me just say one thing. The question of agriculture came up a minute ago. Net farm income is off 50 percent in the last 3 years, and every farmer knows it. And the effect of these economic policies is like a massive grain embargo, which has caused farm exports to drop 20 percent. It\\'s been a big failure. I opposed the grain embargo in my administration. I\\'m opposed to these policies as well.MS. WALTERS: I\\'m sitting here like the great schoolteacher, letting you both get away with things -- because one did it, the other one did it. May I ask in the future that the rebuttal stick to what the rebuttal is. And also, foreign policy will be the next debate. Stop dragging it in by its ear into this one. [Laughter]Now, having admonished you, I would like to say to the panel, you are allowed one question and one followup. Would you try, as best you could, not to ask two and three -- I know it\\'s something we all want to do -- two and three questions as part one and two and three as part two.Having said that, Fred, it\\'s yours.Federal TaxationMR. BARNES: Thank you. Mr. Mondale, let me ask you about middle-class Americans and the taxes they pay. Now, I\\'m talking not about the rich or the poor -- I know your views on their taxes -- but about families earning 25,000 to 45,000 a year. Do you think that those families are overtaxed or undertaxed by the Federal Government?MR. MONDALE: In my opinion, as we deal with this deficit, people from about $70,000 a year on down have to be dealt with very, very carefully, because they are the ones who didn\\'t get any relief the first time around.Under the 1981 tax bill, people making $200,000 a year got $60,000 in tax relief over 3 years, while people making $30,000 a year, all taxes considered, got no relief at all or their taxes actually went up. That\\'s why my proposal protects everybody from $25,000 a year or less against any tax increases, and treats those $70,000 and under in a way that is more beneficial than the way the President proposes with a sales tax or a flat tax.What does this mean in real life? Well, the other day, Vice President Bush disclosed his tax returns to the American people. He\\'s one of the wealthiest Americans, and he\\'s our Vice President. In 1981 I think he paid about 40 percent in taxes. In 1983, as a result of these tax preferences, he paid a little over 12 percent, 12.8 percent in taxes. That meant that he paid a lower percent in taxes than the janitor who cleaned up his office or the chauffeur who drives him to work.I believe we need some fairness. And that\\'s why I\\'ve proposed what I think is a fair and a responsible proposal that helps protect these people who\\'ve already got no relief or actually got a tax increase.MR. BARNES: It sounds as if you are saying you think this group of taxpayers making 25,000 to 45,000 a year is already overtaxed, yet your tax proposal would increase their taxes. I think your aides have said those earning about 25,000 to 35,000, their tax rate would go up -- their tax bill would go up a hundred dollars, and from 35,000 to 45,000, more than that, several hundred dollars. Wouldn\\'t that stifle their incentive to work and invest and so on, and also hurt the recovery?MR. MONDALE: The first thing is, everybody 25,000 and under would have no tax increase.Mr. Reagan, after the election, is going to have to propose a tax increase, and you will have to compare what he proposes. And his Secretary of the Treasury said he\\'s studying a sales tax or a value-added tax. They\\'re the same thing. They hit middle- and moderate-income Americans and leave wealthy Americans largely untouched.Up until about $70,000, as you go up the ladder, my proposals will be far more beneficial. As soon as we get the economy on a sound ground as well, I\\'d like to see the total repeal of indexing. I don\\'t think we can do that for a few years. But at some point, we want to do that as well.MR. BARNES: Mr. President, let me try this on you. Do you think middle-income Americans are overtaxed or undertaxed?THE PRESIDENT: You know, I wasn\\'t going to say this at all, but I can\\'t help it. There you go again. [Laughter] I don\\'t have a plan to tax -- or increase taxes. I\\'m not going to increase taxes. I can understand why you are, Mr. Mondale, because as a Senator you voted 16 times to increase taxes.Now, I believe that our problem has not been that anybody in our country is undertaxed; it\\'s that government is overfed. And I think that most of our people -- this is why we had a 25-percent tax cut across the board which maintained the same progressivity of our tax structure in the brackets on up. And, as a matter of fact, it just so happens that in the quirks of administering these taxes, those above $50,000 actually did not get quite as big a tax cut percentage-wise as did those from 50,000 down. From 50,000 down, those people paid two-thirds of the taxes, and those people got two-thirds of the tax cut.Now, the Social Security tax of \\'77 -- this indeed was a tax that hit people in the lower brackets the hardest. It had two features. It had several tax increases phased in over a period of time -- there are two more yet to come between now and 1989. At the same time every year, it increased the amount of money -- virtually every year, there may have been one or two that were skipped in there -- that was subject to that tax. Today it is up to about $38,000 of earnings that is subject to the payroll tax for Social Security. And that tax, there are no deductions, so a person making anywhere from 10, 15, 20 -- they\\'re paying that tax on the full gross earnings that they have after they have already paid an income tax on that same amount of money.Now, I don\\'t think that to try and say that we were taxing the rich, and not the other way around, it just doesn\\'t work out that way. The system is still where it was with regard to the progressivity, as I\\'ve said, and that has not been changed. But if you take it in numbers of dollars instead of percentage, yes, you could say, well, that person got 10 times as much as this other person. Yes, but he paid 10 times as much, also. But if you take it in percentages, then you find out that it is fair and equitable across the board.MR. BARNES: I thought I caught, Mr. President, a glimmer of a stronger statement there in your answer than you\\'ve made before. I think the operative position you had before was that you would only raise taxes in a second term as a last resort, and I thought you said flatly that \"I\\'m not going to raise taxes.\\'\\' Is that what you meant to say, that you will not -- that you will flatly not raise taxes in your second term as President?THE PRESIDENT: Yes, I had used -- \"last resort\\'\\' would always be with me. If you got the Government down to the lowest level, that you yourself could say it could not go any lower and still perform the services for the people, and if the recovery was so complete that you knew you were getting the ultimate amount of revenues that you could get through that growth, and there was still some slight difference there between those two lines, then I had said once that, yes, you would have to then look to see if taxes should not be adjusted.I don\\'t foresee those things happening, so I say with great confidence I\\'m not going to go for a tax.With regard to assailing Mr. Bush about his tax problems and the difference from the tax he once paid and then the later tax he paid, I think if you looked at the deductions, there were great legal expenses in there -- had to do, possibly, with the sale of his home, and they had to do with his setting up of a blind trust. All of those are legally deductions, deductible in computing your tax, and it was a 1-year thing with him.MS. WALTERS: Mr. Mondale, here we go again. It\\'s time for rebuttal.MR. MONDALE: Well, first of all, I gave him the benefit of the doubt on the house deal. I\\'m just talking about the 12.8 percent that he paid, and that\\'s what\\'s happening all over this country with wealthy Americans. They\\'ve got so many loopholes they don\\'t have to pay much in taxes.Now, Mr. President, you said, \"There you go again,\\'\\' right?THE PRESIDENT: Yes.MR. MONDALE: You remember the last time you said that?THE PRESIDENT: Mm-hmm.MR. MONDALE: You said it when President Carter said that you were going to cut Medicare, and you said, \"Oh, no, there you go again, Mr. President.\\'\\' And what did you do right after the election? You went out and tried to cut $20 billion out of Medicare. And so, when you say, \"There you go again\\'\\' -- people remember this, you know. [Laughter] And people will remember that you signed the biggest tax increase in the history of California and the biggest tax increase in the history of the United States, and what are you going to do? You\\'ve got a $260 billion deficit. You can\\'t wish it away. You won\\'t slow defense spending; you refuse to do that -- --MS. WALTERS: Mr. Mondale, I\\'m afraid your time is up.MR. MONDALE: Sorry.MS. WALTERS: Mr. President?THE PRESIDENT: Yes. With regard to Medicare, no, but it\\'s time for us to say that Medicare is in pretty much the same condition that Social Security was, and something is going to have to be done in the next several years to make it fiscally sound. And, no, I never proposed any $20 billion should come out of Medicare; I have proposed that the program we must treat with that particular problem. And maybe part of that problem is because during the 4 years of the Carter-Mondale administration medical costs in this country went up 87 percent.MS. WALTERS: All right. Fine.THE PRESIDENT: I gave you back some of that time. [Laughter]MS. WALTERS: We can\\'t keep going back for other rebuttals; there\\'ll be time later.We now go to our final round. The way things stand now, we have time for only two sets of questions, and by lot, it will be Jim and Diane. And we\\'ll start with Jim Wieghart.Social Welfare ProgramsMR. WIEGHART: Mr. President, the economic recovery is real, but uneven. The Census Bureau, just a month ago, reported that there are more people living under poverty now, a million more people living under it, than when you took office.There have been a number of studies, including studies by the Urban Institute and other nonpolitical organizations, that say that the impact of the tax and budget cuts and your economic policies have impacted severely on certain classes of Americans -- working mothers, head of households, minority groups, elderly poor. In fact, they\\'re saying the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer under your policies.What relief can you offer to the working poor, to the minorities, and to the women head of households who have borne the brunt of these economic programs? What can you offer them in the future, in your next term?THE PRESIDENT: Well, some of those facts and figures just don\\'t stand up. Yes, there has been an increase in poverty, but it is a lower rate of increase than it was in the preceding years before we got here. It has begun to decline, but it is still going up.On the other hand, women heads of household -- single women heads of household have -- for the first time there\\'s been a turndown in the rate of poverty for them. We have found also in our studies that in this increase in poverty, it all had to do with their private earnings. It had nothing to do with the transfer of payments from government by way of many programs.We are spending now 37 percent more on food for the hungry in all the various types of programs than was spent in 1980. We\\'re spending a third more on all of the -- well, all of the programs of human service. We have more people receiving food stamps than were ever receiving them before -- 2,300,000 more are receiving them -- even though we took 850,000 off the food stamp rolls because they were making an income that was above anything that warranted their fellow citizens having to support them. We found people making 185 percent of the poverty level were getting government benefits. We have set a line at 130 percent so that we can direct that aid down to the truly needy.Some time ago, Mr. Mondale said something about education and college students and help of that kind. Half -- one out of two of the full-time college students in the United States are receiving some form of Federal aid. But there, again, we found people that there under the previous administration, families that had no limit to income were still eligible for low-interest college loans. We didn\\'t think that was right. And so, we have set a standard that those loans and those grants are directed to the people who otherwise could not go to college, their family incomes were so low.So, there are a host of other figures that reveal that the grant programs are greater than they have ever been, taking care of more people than they ever have. 7.7 million elderly citizens who were living in the lowest 20 percent of earnings -- 7.7 million have moved up into another bracket since our administration took over, leaving only 5 million of the elderly in that bracket when there had been more than 13 million.MR. WIEGHART: Mr. President, in a visit to Texas -- in Brownsville, I believe it was, in the Rio Grande Valley -- you did observe that the economic recovery was uneven.THE PRESIDENT: Yes.MR. WIEGHART: In that particular area of Texas, unemployment was over 14 percent, whereas statewide, it was the lowest in the country, I believe -- 5.6 percent. And you made the comment, however, that man does not live by bread alone. What did you mean by that comment? And if I interpret it correctly, it would be a comment more addressed to the affluent who obviously can look beyond just the bread they need to sustain them, with their wherewithal.THE PRESIDENT: That had nothing to do with the other thing of talking about their needs or anything. I remember distinctly, I was segueing into another subject. I was talking about the things that have been accomplished, and that was referring to the revival of patriotism and optimism, the new spirit that we\\'re finding all over America. And it is a wonderful thing to see when you get out there among the people. So, that was the only place that that was used.I did avoid, I\\'m afraid, in my previous answer, also, the idea of uneven, yes. There is no way that the recovery is even across the country, just as in the depths of the recession, there were some parts of the country that were worse off, but some that didn\\'t even feel the pain of the recession.We\\'re not going to rest and not going to be happy until every person in this country who wants a job can have one, until the recovery is complete across the country.MR. WIEGHART: Mr. Mondale, as you can gather from the question to the President, the celebrated War on Poverty obviously didn\\'t end the problem of poverty, although it may have dented it. The poor and the homeless and the disadvantaged are still with us. What should the Federal Government\\'s role be to turn back the growth in the number of people living below the poverty level, which is now 35 million in the United States, and to help deal with the structural unemployment problems that the President was referring to in an uneven recovery?MR. MONDALE: Number one, we\\'ve got to get the debt down to get the interest rates down so the economy will grow and people will be employed.Number two, we have to work with cities and others to help generate economic growth in those communities -- through the Urban Development Action Grant Program. I don\\'t mind those enterprise zones; let\\'s try them, but not as a substitute for the others. Certainly education and training is crucial. If these young Americans don\\'t have the skills that make them attractive to employees, they\\'re not going to get jobs.The next thing is to try to get more entrepreneurship in business within the reach of minorities so that these businesses are located in the communities in which they\\'re found. The other thing is, we need the business community as well as government heavily involved in these communities to try to get economic growth.There is no question that the poor are worse off. I think the President genuinely believes that they\\'re better off. But the figures show that about 8 million more people are below the poverty line than 4 years ago. How you can cut school lunches, how you can cut student assistance, how you can cut housing, how you can cut disability benefits, how you can do all of these things and then the people receiving them -- for example, the disabled, who have no alternative -- how they\\'re going to do better, I don\\'t know. Now, we need a tight budget, but there\\'s no question that this administration has singled out things that affect the most vulnerable in American life, and they\\'re hurting.One final point if I might. There\\'s another part of the lopsided economy that we\\'re in today, and that is that these heavy deficits have killed exports and are swamping the Nation with cheap imports. We are now $120 billion of imports, 3 million jobs lost, and farmers are having their worst year. That\\'s another reason to get the deficit down.MR. WIEGHART: Mr. Mondale, is it possible that the vast majority of Americans who appear to be prosperous have lost interest in the kinds of programs you\\'re discussing to help those less privileged than they are?MR. MONDALE: I think the American people want to make certain that that dollar is wisely spent. I think they stand for civil rights. I know they\\'re all for education in science and training, which I strongly support. They want these young people to have a chance to get jobs and the rest. I think the business community wants to get involved. I think they\\'re asking for new and creative ways to try to reach it with everyone involved. I think that\\'s part of it. I think also that the American people want a balanced program that gives us long-term growth so that they\\'re not having to take money that\\'s desperate to themselves and their families and give it to someone else. I\\'m opposed to that, too.MS. WALTERS: And now it is time for our rebuttal for this period. Mr. President?THE PRESIDENT: Yes. The connection that\\'s been made again between the deficit and the interest rates -- there is no connection between them. There is a connection between interest rates and inflation, but I would call to your attention that in 1981 while we were operating still on the Carter-Mondale budget that we inherited -- that the interest rates came down from 21\\\\1/2\\\\, down toward the 12 or 13 figure. And while they were coming down, the deficits had started their great increase. They were going up. Now, if there was a connection I think that there would be a different parallel between deficits getting larger and interest rates going down.The interest rates are based on inflation. And right now I have to tell you I don\\'t think there is any excuse for the interest rates being as high as they are because we have brought inflation down so low. I think it can only be that they\\'re anticipating or hope -- expecting, not hoping, that maybe we don\\'t have a control of inflation and it\\'s going to go back up again. Well, it isn\\'t going to go back up. We\\'re going to see that it doesn\\'t.And I haven\\'t got time to answer with regard to the disabled.MS. WALTERS: Thank you, Mr. President.MR. MONDALE:MR. MONDALE: Mr. President, if I heard you correctly, you said that these deficits don\\'t have anything to do with interest rates. I will grant you that interest rates were too high in 1980, and we can have another debate as to why -- energy prices and so on. There\\'s no way of glossing around that. But when these huge deficits went in place in 1981, what\\'s called the real interest rates -- the spread between inflation and what a loan costs you doubled -- and that\\'s still the case today. And the result is interest costs that have never been seen before in terms of real charges, and it\\'s attributable to the deficit.Everybody -- every economist, every businessman -- believes that. Your own Council of Economic Advisers -- Mr. Feldstein in his report told you that. Every chairman of the Finance and Ways and Means Committee, Republican leaders in the Senate and the House are telling you that. That deficit is ruining the long-term hopes for this economy. It\\'s causing high interest rates. It\\'s ruining us in trade. It\\'s given us the highest small business failure in 50 years. The economy is starting downhill with housing failure -- --MS. WALTERS: Thank you, Mr. Mondale.You\\'re both very obedient. I have to give you credit for that.We now start our final round of questions. We do want to have time for your rebuttal.We start with Diane -- Diane Sawyer.Presidential CampaignMS. SAWYER: Since we are reaching the end of the question period, and since in every Presidential campaign, the candidates tend to complain that the opposition candidate is not held accountable for what he or she says, let me give you the chance to do that.Mr. Mondale, beginning with you. What do you think the most outrageous thing is your opponent said in this debate tonight? [Laughter]MR. MONDALE: Do you want to give me some suggestions? [Laughter] I\\'m going to use my time a little differently. I\\'m going to give the President some credit. I think the President has done some things to raise the sense of spirit, morale, good feeling in this country, and he\\'s entitled to credit for that. What I think we need, however, is not just that but to move forward, not just congratulating ourselves but challenging ourselves to get on with the business of dealing with America\\'s problems.I think in education, when he lectured the country about the importance of discipline, I didn\\'t like it at first, but I think it helped a little bit. But now we need both that kind of discipline and the resources and the consistent leadership that allows this country to catch up in education and science and training.I like President Reagan. And this is not personal -- there are deep differences about our future, and that\\'s the basis of my campaign.MS. SAWYER: Follow up in a similar vein, then. What remaining question would you most like to see your opponent forced to answer?MR. MONDALE: Without any doubt, I have stood up and told the American people that that $263 billion deficit must come down. And I\\'ve done what no candidate for President has ever done, I told you before the election what I\\'d do.Mr. Reagan, as you saw tonight -- President Reagan takes the position it will disappear by magic. It was once called voodoo economics. I wish the President would say: Yes, the CBO is right. Yes, we have a $263 billion deficit. This is how I\\'m going to get it done. Don\\'t talk about growth, because even though we need growth, that\\'s not helping. It\\'s going to go in the other direction, as they\\'ve estimated.And give us a plan. What will you cut? Whose taxes will you raise? Will you finally touch that defense budget? Are you going to go after Social Security and Medicare and student assistance and the handicapped again as you did last time? If you\\'d just tell us what you\\'re going to do, then the American people could compare my plan for the future with your plan. And that\\'s the way it should be. The American people would be in charge.MS. SAWYER: Mr. President, the most outrageous thing your opponent has said in the debate tonight?THE PRESIDENT: Well, now, I have to start with a smile, since his kind words to me.I\\'ll tell you what I think has been the most outrageous thing in political dialog, both in this campaign and the one in \\'82. And that is the continued discussion and claim that somehow I am the villain who is going to pull the Social Security checks out from those people who are dependent on them.And why I think it is outrageous -- first of all, it isn\\'t true. But why it is outrageous is because, for political advantage, every time they do that, they scare millions of senior citizens who are totally dependent on Social Security, have no place else to turn. And they have to live and go to bed at night thinking, \"Is this true? Is someone going to take our check away from us and leave us destitute?\\'\\' And I don\\'t think that that should be a part of political dialog.Now, to -- I still -- I just have a minute here?MS. WALTERS: You have more time.THE PRESIDENT: Oh, I -- --MS. WALTERS: You can keep going.THE PRESIDENT: Okay. All right.Now, Social Security, let\\'s lay it to rest once and for all. I told you never would I do such a thing. But I tell you also now, Social Security has nothing to do with the deficit. Social Security is totally funded by the payroll tax levied on employer and employee. If you reduce the out-go of Social Security, that money would not go into the general fund to reduce a deficit. It would go into the Social Security Trust Fund. So, Social Security has nothing to do with balancing a budget or erasing or lowering the deficit.Now, again, to get to whether I am depending on magic, I think I have talked in straight economic terms about a program of recovery that I was told wouldn\\'t work. And then, after it worked, I was told that lowering taxes would increase inflation. And none of these things happened. It is working, and we\\'re going to continue on that same line.As to what we might do, and find in further savings cuts, no, we\\'re not going to starve the hungry. But we have 2,478 specific recommendations from a commission of more than 2,000 business people in this country, through the Grace commission, that we\\'re studying right now -- and we\\'ve already implemented 17 percent of them -- that are recommendations as to how to make government more efficient, more economic.MS. SAWYER: And to keep it even, what remaining question would you most like to see your opponent forced to answer?THE PRESIDENT: Why the deficits are so much of a problem for him now, but that in 1976, when the deficit was $52 billion and everyone was panicking about that, he said, no, that he thought it ought to be bigger, because a bigger deficit would stimulate the economy and would help do away with unemployment. In 1979 he made similar statements, the same effect, that the deficits -- there was nothing wrong with having deficits.Remember, there was a trillion dollars in debt before we got here. That\\'s got to be paid by our children and grandchildren, too, if we don\\'t do it. And I\\'m hoping we can start some payments on it before we get through here. That\\'s why I want another 4 years.MS. WALTERS: Well, we have time now, if you\\'d like to answer the President\\'s question, or whatever rebuttal.MR. MONDALE: Well, we\\'ve just finished almost the whole debate. And the American people don\\'t have the slightest clue about what President Reagan will do about these deficits. [Laughter] And yet, that\\'s the most important single issue of our time.I did support the \\'76 measure that he told about, because we were in a deep recession and we needed some stimulation. But I will say as a Democrat, I was a real piker, Mr. President. In 1979 we ran a $29 billion deficit all year. This administration seems to run that every morning. And the result is exactly what we see. This economy is starting to run downhill. Housing is off. Last report on new purchases, it\\'s the lowest since 1982. Growth is a little over 3 percent now. Many people are predicting a recession. And the flow of imports into this country is swamping the American people.We\\'ve got to deal with this problem, and those of us who want to be your President should tell you now what we\\'re going to do, so you can make a judgment.MS. WALTERS: Thank you very much. We must stop now. I want to give you time for your closing statements. It\\'s indeed time for that from each of you. We will begin with President Reagan.Oh, I\\'m sorry, Mr. Reagan, you had your rebuttal, and I just cut you off because our time is going. You have a chance now for rebuttal before your closing statement. Is that correct?THE PRESIDENT: No, I might as well just go with -- --MS. WALTERS: Do you want to go with your -- --THE PRESIDENT: I don\\'t think so. I\\'m all confused now.MS. WALTERS: Technically, you did. I have little voices that come in my ear. [Laughter] You don\\'t get those same voices. I\\'m not hearing it from here -- I\\'m hearing it from here.THE PRESIDENT: All right.MS. WALTERS: You have waived your rebuttal. You can go with your closing statement.Closing StatementsTHE PRESIDENT: Well, we\\'ll include it in that.MS. WALTERS: Okay.THE PRESIDENT: Four years ago, in similar circumstances to this, I asked you, the American people, a question. I asked: \"Are you better off than you were 4 years before?\\'\\' The answer to that obviously was no, and as the result, I was elected to this office and promised a new beginning.Now, maybe I\\'m expected to ask that same question again. I\\'m not going to, because I think that all of you -- or not everyone, those people that are in those pockets of poverty and haven\\'t caught up, they couldn\\'t answer the way I would want them to -- but I think that most of the people in this country would say, yes, they are better off than they were 4 years ago.The question, I think, should be enlarged. Is America better off than it was 4 years ago? And I believe the answer to that has to also be \"yes.\\'\\' I promised a new beginning. So far, it is only a beginning. If the job were finished, I might have thought twice about seeking reelection for this job.But we now have an economy that, for the first time -- well, let\\'s put it this way: In the first half of 1980, gross national product was down a minus 3.7 percent. The first half of \\'84 it\\'s up 8\\\\1/2\\\\ percent. Productivity in the first half of 1980 was down a minus 2 percent. Today it is up a plus 4 percent.Personal earnings after taxes per capita have gone up almost $3,000 in these 4 years. In 1980 -- or 1979, a person with a fixed income of $8,000 was $500 above the poverty line, and this maybe explains why there are the numbers still in poverty. By 1980 that same person was $500 below the poverty line.We have restored much of our economy. With regard to business investment, it is higher than it has been since 1949. So, there seems to be no shortage of investment capital. We have, as I said, cut the taxes, but we have reduced inflation, and for 2 years now it has stayed down there, not at double digit, but in the range of 4 or below. We believe that we had also promised that we would make our country more secure.Yes, we have an increase in the defense budget. But back then we had planes that couldn\\'t fly for lack of spare parts or pilots. We had navy vessels that couldn\\'t leave harbor because of lack of crew or, again, lack of spare parts. Today we\\'re well on our way to a 600-ship navy. We have 543 at present.We have -- our military, the morale is high. I think the people should understand that two-thirds of the defense budget pays for pay and salary, or pay and pension. And then you add to that food and wardrobe, and all the other things, and you only have a small portion going for weapons. But I am determined that if ever our men are called on, they should have the best that we can provide in the manner of tools and weapons. There has been reference to expensive spare parts, hammers costing $500. Well, we are the ones who found those.I think we\\'ve given the American people back their spirit. I think there\\'s an optimism in the land and a patriotism, and I think that we\\'re in a position once again to heed the words of Thomas Paine, who said: \"We have it in our power to begin the world over again.\\'\\'MS. WALTERS: Thank you, Mr. Reagan.Mr. Mondale, the closing words are now yours.MR. MONDALE: I want to thank the League of Women Voters and the city of Louisville for hosting this evening\\'s debate. I want to thank President Reagan for agreeing to debate. He didn\\'t have to, and he did, and we all appreciate it.The President\\'s favorite question is: Are you better off? Well, if you\\'re wealthy, you\\'re better off. If you\\'re middle income, you\\'re about where you were. And if you\\'re modest income, you\\'re worse off. That\\'s what the economists tell us.But is that really the question that should be asked? Isn\\'t the real question is will we be better off? Will our children be better off? Are we building the future that this nation needs? I believe that if we ask those questions that bear on our future, not just congratulate ourselves but challenge us to solve those problems, you\\'ll see that we need new leadership.Are we better of with this arms race? Will we be better off if we start this star wars escalation into the heavens? Are we better off when we deemphasize our values in human rights? Are we better off when we load our children with this fantastic debt? Would fathers and mothers feel proud of themselves if they loaded their children with debts like this nation is now -- over a trillion dollars on the shoulders of our children? Can we say, really say that we will be better off when we pull away from sort of that basic American instinct of decency and fairness?I would rather lose a campaign about decency than win a campaign about self-interest. I don\\'t think this nation is composed of people who care only for themselves. And when we sought to assault Social Security and Medicare, as the record shows we did, I think that was mean-spirited. When we terminated 400,000 desperate, hopeless, defenseless Americans who were on disability -- confused and unable to defend themselves, and just laid them out on the street, as we did for 4 years, I don\\'t think that\\'s what America is all about.America is a fair society, and it is not right that Vice President Bush pays less in taxes than the janitor who helps him. I believe there\\'s fundamental fairness crying out that needs to be achieved in our tax system.I believe that we will be better off if we protect this environment. And contrary to what the President says, I think their record on the environment is inexcusable and often shameful. These laws are not being enforced, have not been enforced, and the public health and the air and the water are paying the price. That\\'s not fair for our future.I think our future requires a President to lead us in an all-out search to advance our education, our learning, and our science and training, because this world is more complex and we\\'re being pressed harder all the time.I believe in opening doors. We won the Olympics, in part, because we\\'ve had civil rights laws and the laws that prohibit discrimination against women. I have been for those efforts all my life. The President\\'s record is quite different.The question is our future. President Kennedy once said in response to similar arguments, \"We are great, but we can be greater.\\'\\' We can be better if we face our future, rejoice in our strengths, face our problems, and by solving them, build a better society for our children.Thank you.MS. WALTERS: Thank you, Mr. Mondale. [Applause] Please, we have not finished quite yet.Thank you, Mr. Mondale, and thank you, Mr. President. And our thanks to our panel members, as well.And so we bring to a close this first of the League of Women Voters Presidential debates of 1984. You two can go at each again in the final League debate on October 21st, in Kansas City, Missouri.

       " 'September 23, 1976 Debate TranscriptSeptember 23, 1976The First Carter-Ford Presidential DebateEDWIN NEWMAN, MODERATOR: Good evening. I\\'m Edwin Newman, moderator of this first debate of the 1976 campaign between Gerald R. Ford of Michigan, Republican candidate for president, and Jimmy Carter of Georgia, Democratic candidate for president. We thank you, President Ford and we thank you, Governor Carter, for being with us tonight. There are to be three debates between the presidential candidates and one between the vice-presidential candidates. All are being arranged by the League of Women Voters Education Fund. Tonight\\'s debate, the first between presidential candidates in sixteen years and the first ever in which an incumbent president has participated, is taking place before an audience in the Walnut Street Theater in Philadelphia, just three blocks from Independence Hall. The television audience may reach a hundred million in the United States and many millions overseas. Tonight\\'s debate focuses on domestic issues and economic policy. Questions will be put by Frank Reynolds of ABC News, James Gannon of the Wall Street Journal, and Elizabeth Drew of the New Yorker magazine. Under the agreed rules the first question will go to Governor Carter. That was decided by the toss of a coin. He will have up to three minutes to answer. One follow-up question will be permitted with up to two minutes to reply. President Ford will then have two minutes to respond. The next question will go to President Ford with the same time arrangements, and questions will continue to be alternated between the candidates. Each man will make a three-minute statement at the end, Governor Carter to go first. President Ford and Governor Carter do not have any notes or prepared remarks with them this evening. Mr. Reynolds, your question for Governor Carter.MR. REYNOLDS: Mr. President, Governor Carter. Governor, in an interview with the Associated Press last week, you said you believed these debates would alleviate a lot of concern that some voters have about you. Well, one of those concerns, not an uncommon one about uh - candidates in any year, is that many voters say they don\\'t really know where you stand. Now, you have made jobs your number one priority and you have said you are committed to a drastic reduction in unemployment. Can you say now, Governor, in specific terms, what your first step would be next January, if you are elected, to achieve that.MR. CARTER: Yes. First of all is to recognize a tremendous economic strength in this country and to set the putting to - back to work of our people as a top priority. This is uh - an effort that ought to be done primarily by strong leadership in the White House, the inspiration of our people, the tapping of uh - business, agriculture, industry, labor and government at all levels to work on this uh project. We\\'ll never have uh - an end to the inflationary spiral, and we\\'ll never have a balanced budget until we get our people back to work. There are several things that can be done specifically that are not now being done. First of all, to channel research and development funds into areas that will provide uh large numbers of jobs. Secondly, we need to have a commitment in the uh private sector uh - to cooperate with government in matters like housing. Here a very small investment of taxpayer\\'s money - in the housing field can bring large numbers of extra jobs, and the guarantee of mortgage loans, and the uh - putting forward of uh - two-0-two programs for housing for older people and so forth to cut down the roughly 20 percent unemployment that now exists in the - in the construction industry. Another thing is to deal with our - uh needs in the central cities, where the unemployment rate is extremely high: sometimes among minority groups, or those who don\\'t speak English, or who\\'re black, or young people, or - 40 percent of the employment. Here a CCC type program would be appropriate to channel money into the ah - cha- in - in into the sharing with the private sector and also local and state governments to employ young people who are now out of work. Another very important - uh aspect of our - uh economy would be to increase production in every way possible, uh to hold down - uh taxes on individuals, and to uh shift the tax burdens onto those who have avoided paying taxes in the past. These uh - kinds of specific things, uh none of which are being done now, would be a great help in - in reducing uh unemployment. There is uh - uh an additional factor that needs to be done and covered very - very succinctly, and that is, to make sure that we have a good relationship between management - business on the one hand, and labor, on the other. In a &gt; Transfer interrupted! ery high, we might channel specific uh targeted job - job - uh opportunities by paying part of the salary of unemployed people - uh and also sharing with uh - local governments the uh - payment of salaries which would uh - let us cut down the unemployment rate much lower, before we hit the inflationary level. But I believe that by the end of the first four years of uh - of the next term we could have the unemployment down to 3 percent adult unemployment, which is about uh - 4 to 4 and a half percent overall uh controlled inflation rate and have a uh balance of growth of about - uh 4 to 6 percent, around 5 percent which would give us a balanced budget.MR. REYNOLDS: Governor, uh - in the event you are successful and you do achieve a drastic dropMR. CARTER: Yes, in unemployment that is likely to create additional pressure on prices, how willing are you to consider an incomes policy, in other words, wage and price controls?MR. CARTER: Well - we now have such uh - a low utilization of uh - our productive capacity - uh about 73 percent; I think it\\'s about the lowest since the Great Depression years - and such a high unemployment rate now - uh 7.9 percent - that - uh we have a long way to go in getting people to work before we have the inflationary pressures. And I think this would uh - this would be uh easy to accomplish, to get jobs down, without having strong in- inflationary pressures that - that would be necessary. I would not favor the uh - payment of uh - of a given fixed income to people unless they are not able to work. But with tax incentives for the low-income groups we could build up their uh - income levels uh - above the poverty level and not uh make welfare more uh - profitable than - than work.MR. NEWMAN: Mr. President, your response.MR. FORD: I don\\'t believe that uh that Mr. Carter\\'s been any more specific in this case than he has been on many other instances. I notice particularly that he didn\\'t endorse the Humphrey-Hawkins bill which he has on occasions and which is included as a part of the Democratic platform. That legislation uh allegedly would help our unemployment, but uh - we all know that it would\\'ve controlled our economy, it would\\'ve added uh - ten to thirty billion dollars each year in additional expenditures by the Federal Government. It would\\'ve called for export controls on agricultural products In my judgment the best way to get jobs is to uh - expand the private sector, where five out of six jobs today exist in our economy. We can do that by reducing Federal taxes as I proposed uh - about a year ago when I called for a tax reduction of $28 billion - three-quarters of it to go to private uh taxpayers and uh one-quarter to the business sector. We could add to jobs in the major metropolitan areas by a proposal that I recommended that would give tax incentives to business to move into the inner city and to expand or to build new plants so that they would take a plant, or expand a plant where people are, and people are currently unemployed. We could uh - also uh - help our youths with some of the proposals that uh - would give to young people an opportunity to work and learn at the same time just like we give money to young people who are going to college. Those are the kind of specifics that I think we have to discuss on these uh - debates, and these are the kind of programs that I\\'ll talk about on my time.MR. NEWMAN: Mr. Gannon, your question to President Ford.MR. GANNON: Mr. President, I would like to continue for a moment on this uh question of taxes which you have just raised. You have said that you favor more tax cuts for middle-income Americans - even those earning up to $30 thousand a year. That presumably would cost the Treasury quite a bit of money in lost revenue. In view of the very large budget deficits that you have accumulated and that are still in prospect, how is it possible to promise further tax cuts and to reach your goal of balancing the budget?MR. FORD: At the time, Mr. Gannon, that I made the recommendation for a $28 billion tax cut - three-quarters of it to go to individual taxpayers and 25 percent to American business. I said at the time that we had to hold the lid an federal spending, that for every dollar of a tax reduction we had to have an equal reduction in federal expenditures - a one-for-one proposition. And I recommended that to the Congress with a budget ceiling of three hundred and ninety-five billion dollars, and that would have permitted us to have a $25 billion tax reduction. In my tax reduction program for middle-income taxpayers, I recommended that the Congress increase personal exemptions from seven hundred and fifty dollars per person to one thousand dollars per person. That would mean, of course, that for a family of four that that family would have a thousand dollars more personal exemption - money that they could spend for their own purposes, money that the government wouldn\\'t have to spend. But if we keep the lid on federal spending, which I think we can - with the help of the Congress, we can justify fully a $28 billion tax reduction. In the budget that I submitted to the Congress in January this year, I re- recommended a 50 percent cutback in the rate of growth of federal spending. For the last ten years the budget of the United States has grown from uh - about 11 percent per year. We can\\'t afford that kind of growth in federal spending. And in the budget that I recommended we cut it in half - a growth rate of 5 to 5 and one-half percent. With that kind of limitation, on federal spending, we can fully justify the tax reductions that I have proposed. And it seems to me with the stimulant of more money in the hands of the taxpayers, and with more money in the hands of business to expand, to modernize, to provide more jobs, our economy stimulated so that we\\'ll get more revenue and we\\'ll have a more prosperous economy.MR. GANNON: Mr. President, to follow up a moment, uh - the Congress has passed a tax bill which is before you now, which did not meet exactly the uh - sort of outline that you requested. What is your intention on that bill, uh - since it doesn\\'t meet your - your requirements? Do you plan to sign that bill?MR. FORD: That tax bill does not entirely meet the criteria that I established. I think the Congress should have uh - added another $10 billion reduction in personal income taxes, including the increase of personal exemptions from seven hundred and fifty to a thousand dollars. And Congress could have done that if the budget committees of the Congress, and the Congress as a whole, had not increased the spending that I recommended in the budget. I\\'m sure that you know that in the resolutions passed by the Congress, that have added about $17 billion in more spending, by the Congress over the budget that I recommended. So I would prefer in that tax bill to have an additional tax cut and a further limitation on federal spending. Now this tax bill - that hasn\\'t reached the White House yet, but is expected in a day or two - it\\'s about fifteen hundred pages. It has some good provisions in it. It has - uh left out some that I have recommended, unfortunately. On the other hand, uh when you have a bill of that magnitude, with - tho- those many provisions, a president has to sit and decide if there\\'s more good than bad. And from the a- analysis that I\\'ve made so far, it seems to me that that tax bill does uh - justify my signature and my approval.MR. NEWMAN: Governor Carter, your response.MR. CARTER: Well, Mr. Ford is - is uh changing uh considerably his previous philosophy. The present tax structure is a disgrace to this country; it\\'s just a welfare program for the rich. As a matter of fact, uh - 25 percent of the total tax deductions, go for only 1 percent of the richest people in this country, and over 50 percent of the tax uh credits go for the 14 percent of the richest people in this country. When Mr. Ford first became president in - in August of 1974, the first thing he did in - in October was to ask for a $4.7 billion increase in taxes on our people in the midst of the heaviest recession, since uh - since the great depression of nineteen uh - of the 1940s. In uh - January of 1975 he asked for a tax change: a $5.6 billion increase on low-and-middle-income private individuals, a six and a half billion dollar decrease on the corporations and the special interests. In uh - December of uh - 1975 he vetoed the roughly 18 to 20 billion dollar uh tax-reduction bill that had been passed by the Congress, and then he came back later on in January of this year and he did advocate a $10 billion tax reduction, but it would be offset by a $6 billion increase this coming January in deductions for Social Security payments and for unemployment compensation. The whole philosophy of the Republican party, including uh - my opponent, has been to pile on taxes on low-income people to take \\'em off on the corporations. As a matter fact, in - sin- since the late sixties when Mr. Nixon took office, we\\'ve had a reduction in uh - in the percentage of taxes paid by corporations from 30 percent down to about 20 percent. We\\'ve had an increase in taxes paid by individuals, payroll taxes, from14 Percent up to 20 percent. And this is what the Republicans have done to us. And this is why a tax reform is so important.MR. NEWMAN: Mrs. Drew, your question to Governor Carter.MS. DREW: Uh Governor Carter, you proposed a number of new or enlarged programs, including jobs, health, welfare reform, child care, aid to education, aid to cities, changes in social security and housing subsidies. You\\'ve also said that you wanna balance the budget by the end of your first term. Now you haven\\'t put a price tag on those programs, but even if we price them conservatively and we count for full employment by the end of your first term, and we count for the economic growth that would occur during that period, there still isn\\'t enough money to pay for those programs and balance the budget by any - any estimates that I\\'ve been able to see. So, in that case what would give?MR. CARTER: Well, as a matter of fact there is. If we assume the ah - uh - a rate of growth of our economy, equivalent to what it was during President Johnson, President Kennedy, even before the - the - the - uh wa uh - Vietnese- namese War, and if we assume that at the end of the four-year period we can cut our unemployment rate down to 4 to 4 and a half percent - under those circumstances, even assuming no elimination of unnecessary programs and assuming an increase in the ad- in the allotment of money to finance programs, increasing as the inflation rate does - my economic projections, I think confirmed by the House uh - and the Senate committees, have been with the $60 billion extra amount of money that can be spent in fiscal year \\'81 which will be the last year of this next term. Within that sixty-billion dollars increase there would be fit the programs that I promised the American people. I might say too, that - that if we see that these goals cannot be reached - and I believe they\\'re reasonable goals - then I would cut back on the rate of implement- implementation of new programs in order to accommodate a balanced budget by fiscal year \\'81 which is the last year of the next term. I believe that we ought to have a balanced budget during normal economic circumstances. And uh - these projections have been very carefully made. I stand behind them. And if they should be in error slightly on the down side, then I\\'ll phase in the programs that we\\'ve uh - advocated, more slowly.MS. DREW: Governor, uh - according to the budget committees of the Congress tha- tha- tha- that you referred to, if we get to full employment - what they project at a 4 percent unemployment - and, as you say, even allowing for the inflation in the programs, there would not be anything more than a surplus of $5 billion by the end of ninet- by 1981. And conservative estimates of your programs would be that they\\'d be about 85 to a hundred billion dollars. So how - how do you say that you\\'re going to be able to do these things and balance the budget?MR. CARTER: Well, the uh - the assumption that - that you uh - have described as different is in the rate of growth of our economy.MS. DREW: No, they took that into account in those figures.MR. CARTER: I believe that it\\'s accurate to say that - that the - that the committees to whom you refer with the - the employment that you uh - state, and with the 5 to 5 and a half percent growth rate in our economy, that the uh - projections would be a uh - a $60 billion increase in the amount of money that we\\'d have to spend in l981 compared to now. And uh - with that uh - in that framework would befit the - any improvements in the programs. Now this does not include uh - any uh - uh extra control over uh unnecessary spending, the weeding out of obsolete or obsolescent programs. Uh - we\\'ll have uh - a safety version built in with complete reorganization of the executive branch of government which I am pledged to do. The present bureaucratic structure of the - of the Federal Government is a mess. And if I\\'m elected president that\\'s gonna be a top priority of mine to completely revise the structure of the federal government, to make it economical, efficient, purposeful and manageable for a change. And also, I\\'m going to institute zero-based budgeting which I used four years in Georgia, which uh - assesses every program every year, and eliminates those programs that are obsolete or obsolescent. But with these projections, we will have a balanced budget by fiscal year 1981, if I\\'m elected president. Keep my promises to the American people. And it\\'s just predicated on very modest, but I think accurate, projections of employment increases and uh - a growth in our national economy equal to what was experienced under Kennedy, Johnson, before the Vietnam War.MR. NEWMAN: President Ford.MR. FORD: If it is uh true that there will be a $60 billion surplus by fiscal year 1981, rather than spend that money for all the new programs that Governor Carter recommends and endorses, and which are included in the Democratic platform, I think the American taxpayer ought to get an additional tax break - a tax reduction of that magnitude. I feel that the taxpayers are the ones that need the relief: I don\\'t think we should add additional programs of the magnitude that Governor Carter talks about. It seems to me that our tax structure today has rates that are too high. But I am uh - very glad to point out that since 1969, during a Republican administrations, we have had ten million people taken off of the tax rolls at the lower end of the taxpayer area. And at the same time, assuming that I sign the tax bill that was mentioned by Mr. Gannon, we will in the last two tax bills have increased the minimum tax on all wealthy taxpayers. And I believe that by eliminating ten million taxpayers in the last uh eight years, and by putting a heavier tax burden on those in the higher tax brackets, plus the other actions that\\'ve been taken uh - we can give taxpayers adequate tax relief. Now it seems to me that uh - as we look at the recommendations of the budget committees and our own projections, there isn\\'t going to be any $60 billion dividend. I\\'ve heard of those dividends in the past; it always happens. We expected one at the time of the Vietnam War, but it was used up before we ever ended the war and taxpayers never got the adequate relief they deserved.MR. NEWMAN: Mr. Reynolds.MR. REYNOLDS: Mr. President, when you came into office you spoke very eloquently of the need for a time for healing, and very early in your administration you went out to Chicago and you announced, you proposed a program of uh case-by-case pardons for draft resisters to restore them to full citizenship. Some fourteen thousand young men took advantage of your offer, but another ninety thousand did not. In granting the pardon to former President Nixon, sir, part of your rationale was to put Watergate behind us to - if I may quote you again - truly end our long national nightmare. Why does not the same rationale apply now, today, in our Bicentennial year, to the young men who resisted in Vietnam, and many of them still in exile abroad?MR. FORD: The amnesty program that I recommended in Chicago in September of 1974 would give to all draft evaders and - uh military deserters the opportunity to earn their uh - good record back. About fourteen to fifteen thousand did take advantage of that program. We gave them ample time. I am against- an across-the-board pardon of draft evaders or military deserters. Now in the case of Mr. Nixon, the reason the - the pardon was given, was that, when I took office this country was in a very, very divided condition. There was hatred, there was divisiveness - uh people had lost faith in their government in many, many respects. Mr. Nixon resigned, and I became president. It seemed to me that if I was to uh adequately and effectively handle the problems of high inflation, a growing recession, the uh - involvement of the United States still in Vietnam that I had to give a hundred percent of my time to those two major problems. Mr. Nixon resigned. That is disgrace. The first President out of thirty-eight that ever resigned from public office under pressure. So when you look at the penalty that he paid, and when you analyze the requirements that I had - to spend all of my time working on the economy, which was in trouble, that I inherited; working on our problems in Southeast Asia - which were still plaguing us - it seemed to me that Mr. Nixon had been penalized enough by his resignation in disgrace and the need, and necessity for me to concentrate on the problems of the country fully justified the action that I took.MR. REYNOLDS: I take it then, sir, that you do not believe that uh - it is - that you are going to reconsider and uh - think about those ninety thousand who are still abroad. Uh - have they not been penalized enough - many of \\'em been there for years?MR. FORD: Well, Mr. Carter has uh indicated that uh - he would give a blanket pardon to all uh - draft evaders. I do not agree with that point of view. I gave, in September of 1974, an opportunity for all draft evaders, all deserters, to come in voluntarily, clear their records by earning an opportunity to restore their good citizenship. I think we gave them a good opportunity - we\\'re - I don\\'t think we should go any further.MR. NEWMAN: Governor Carter.MR. CARTER: Well I think it\\'s uh... very difficult for President Ford to uh - explain the difference between the pardon of President Nixon and - and uh - his attitude toward those who violated the draft laws. As a matter of fact - now- I don\\'t advocate amnesty; I advocate pardon. There\\'s a difference in my opinion - uh and in accordance with the ruling of the Supreme Court and accordance with the definition in the dictionary. Amnesty means that - that you uh - that what you did was right. Pardon means that what you did, whether it\\'s right or wrong, you\\'re forgiven for it. And I do advocate a pardon for - for draft evaders. I think it\\'s accurate to say that in uh - two years ago when Mr. Nixon - Mr. Ford put in this uh amnesty that three times as many deserters were uh - excused as were - as were the uh - the ones who evaded the draft. But I think that now is the time to heal our country after the Vietnam War and I think that what the people are concerned about is not the - uh pardon or the amnesty of uh - those who evaded the draft, but - but whether or not our crime system is - is fair. We\\'ve got a - a sharp distinction drawn between white collar crime - the - the - the big shots who are rich, who are influential uh very seldom go to jail; those who are poor and - and who have uh no influence - uh quite often are the ones who are punished. And - and the whole uh subject of crime is one that concerns our people very much, and I believe that the fairness of it is - is what - uh - is a - is a major problem that addresses our - our leader and this is something that hasn\\'t been addressed adequately by - by this administration. But I - I hope to have a complete uh responsibility on my shoulders to help bring about a - a fair uh - criminal justice system and also to - to bring about uh - an end to the - to the divise- divisiveness that has occurred in our country uh as a result of the Vietnam War.MR. NEWMAN: Mr. Gannon.MR. GANNON: Governor Carter, you have promised a sweeping overhaul of the federal government, including a reduction in the number of government agencies - you say it would go down about two hundred from some nineteen hundred. That sounds, indeed, like a very deep cut in the federal government. But isn\\'t it a fact that you\\'re not really talking about fewer federal employees or less government spending, but rather that you are talking about reshaping the federal government, not making it smaller?MR. CARTER: Well, I\\'ve been through this before, Mr. Gannon, as the governor of Georgia. When I took aver we had uh a bureaucratic mess, like we have in Washington now, and we had three hundred agencies, departments, bureaus, commissions - uh some uh - fully budgeted, some not, but all having responsibility to carry out that was in conflict. And we cut those three hundred - uh agencies and so forth down substantially. We eliminated two hundred and seventy-eight of them. We set up a simple structure of government that could be administrated fairly and it was a - a tremendous success. It hasn\\'t been undone since I was there. It resulted also in an ability to reshape our court system, our prison system, our education system, our mental health programs and - and a clear assignment of responsibility and - and authority and also to have uh our people once again understanding control our government. I intend to do the same thing if I\\'m elected president. When I get to Washington, coming in as an outsider, one of the major responsibilities that - that I will have on my shoulder is a complete reorganization of the - of the executive branch of government. We now have uh - a greatly expanded White House staff. When Mr. Nixon went in office, for instance, we had three and a half million dollars spent on - on the White House and its staff. That has escalated now to sixteen and a half million dollars, in the last uh Republican administration. This needs to be changed. We need to put the responsibilities back on the cabinet members. We also need to have a great reduction in agencies and programs. For instance, we now have uh - in the health area three hundred and two different programs administered by eleven major departments and agencies, sixty other advisory commissions responsible for this. Medicaid\\'s in one agency; Medicare is in a different one. The - the check on the quality of health care is in a different one. None of them uh are responsible for health care itself. This makes it almost impossible for us to have a good health program. We have uh - just advocated uh - this past week a consolidation of the responsibilities for energy. Our country now has no comprehensive energy program or policy. We have twenty different agencies in the federal government responsible for the production, the regulation, the uh - information about energy, the conservation of energy, spread all over government. This is a - a gross waste of money, so tough, competent management of government, giving us a simple efficient purposeful and manageable government would be a great step forward and if I\\'m elected - and I intend to be - then it\\'s gonna be done.MR. GANNON: Well, I\\'d like to - to press my question on the number of federal employees - whether you would really plan to reduce the overall - uh number, or - or merely put them in different departments and relabel them. Uh - in your energy plan, you consolidate a number of a - agencies into one, or you would, but uh does that really change the overall?MR. CARTER: I can\\'t say for sure that we would have fewer federal employees when I go out of office than when I come in. It took me about three years to completely reorganize the Georgia government. The last year I was in office uh - our budget was - was actually less than it was a year before, uh which showed a great uh improvement. Also, we had a - a 2 percent increase in the number of employees the last year. But it was a tremendous shift from administrative jobs into the delivery of services. For instance, we uh - completely revised our prison system. We established eighty-four new mental health treatment centers. And we shifted people out of administrative jobs into the field to deliver better services. The same thing will be done uh - at the federal government level. I - I accomplished this with s - substantial reductions in employees in some departments. For instance, in the Transportation Department uh we had uh - we cut back about 25 percent of the total number of employees. In giving our people better mental health care, we increased the number of employees. But the efficiency of it, the simplicity of it, the uh ability of people to understand their own government and control it was a - was a uh - substantial benefit derived from complete reorganization. We uh - have got to do that at the federal government level. If we don\\'t, the bureaucratic mess is going to continue. There\\'s no way for our people now to understand what their government is. There\\'s no way to get the answer to a question. When you come to Washington to try to - as a governor - to try to begin a new program for your people, like uh the treatment of drug addicts, I found there were thirteen different federal agencies that I had to go to, to manage the uh drug treatment program. In the Georgia government we only had one agency responsible for drug treatment. This is the kind of change that would be made. And uh - it would be of - of tremendous benefit in long-range planning, in tight budgeting, uh saving the taxpayers\\' money, making the government more efficient, cutting down on bureaucratic waste, having a clear delineation of authority and responsibility of employees, and giving our people a better chance to understand and control their government.MR. NEWMAN: President Ford.MR. FORD: I think the record should show, Mr. Newman, that uh - the Bureau of Census - we checked it just yesterday - indicates that uh - in the four years that uh - Governor Carter was governor of the state of Georgia, uh - expenditures by the government went up over 50 percent Uh - employees of the government in Georgia during his term of office went up over 25 percent; and the figures also show that the uh, uh - bonded indebtedness of the state of Georgia during his governorship went up over 20 percent. And there was some very interesting testimony given by Governor Carter\\'s successor, Governor Busby, before a Senate committee a few uh - months ago on how he found the Medicaid program when he came into office following Governor Carter. He testified, and these are his words - the present governor of Georgia - he says he found the Medicaid program in Georgia in shambles. Now let me talk about what we\\'ve done in the White House as far as federal employees are concerned The first order that I issued after I became president was to cut or eliminate the prospective forty-thousand increase in federal employees that had been scheduled by my predecessor. And in the term that I\\'ve been president - some two years - we have reduced federal employment by eleven thousand. In the White House staff itself, when I became president, we had roughly five hundred and forty employees. We now have about four hundred and eighty-five employees, so we\\'ve made a rather significant reduction in the number of employees on the White House staff working for the president. So I think our record of cutting back employees, plus the failure on the part of the Governor\\'s programs to actually save employment in Georgia, shows which is the better plan.MR. NEWMAN: Mrs. Drew.MS. DREW: Mr. President, at Vail, after the Republican convention, you announced that you would now emphasize five new areas; among those were jobs and housing and health and improved recreational facilities for Americans. And you also added crime. You also mentioned education. For two years you\\'ve been telling us that we couldn\\'t do very much in these areas because we couldn\\'t afford it; and in fact we do have a $50 billion deficit now. In rebuttal to Governor Carter a little bit earlier, you said that if there were to be any surplus in the next few years you thought it should be turned back to the people in the form of tax relief. So how are you going to pay for any new initiatives in these areas you announced at Vail you were going to now stress?MR. FORD: Well, in the uh - last two years, as I indicated before, we had a very tough time. We were faced with uh - heavy inflation, over 12 percent; we were faced with substantial unemployment. But in the last uh - twenty-four months we\\'ve turned the economy around and we\\'ve brought inflation down to under 6 percent, and we have reduced the uh - well, we have added employment of about four million in the last seventeen months to the point where we have eighty-eight million people working in America today - the most in the history of the country. The net result is we are going to have some improvement in our receipts. And I think we\\'ll have some decrease in our disbursements. We expect to have a lower deficit in fiscal year 1978. We feel that with this improvement in the economy; we feel with more receipts and fewer disbursements we can in a moderate way increase, as I recommended, over the next ten years a new parks program that would cast a billion and a half dollars, doubling our national park system. We have recommended that in the h- housing program we can reduce down payments and moderate monthly payments. But that doesn\\'t cost any more as far as the federal treasury is concerned. We believe that we can uh do a better job in the area of crime, but that requires a tougher sentencing, mandatory certain prison sentences for those who violate our criminal laws. We - uh believe that uh you can revise the federal criminal code, which has not been revised in a good many years. That doesn\\'t cost any more money. We believe that you can uhh - do something more effectively with a moderate increase in money in the drug abuse program. We feel that uh - in education we can have a slight increase - not a major increase. It\\'s my understanding that Governor Carter has indicated that uh - he approves of a $30 billion uh - expenditure by the federal government as far as education is concerned. At the present time we\\'re spending roughly three billion five hundred million dollars. I don\\'t know where that money would come from. But as we look at the quality-of-life programs - jobs, health, education, crime, recreation - we feel that as we move forward with a healthier economy, we can absorb the small necessary cost that will be required.MS. DREW: Sir, in the next few years would you try to reduce the deficit, would you spend more money far these programs that you have just outlined, or would you, as you said earlier, return whatever surplus you got to the people in the form of tax relief?MR. FORD: We feel that uh - with the programs that I have recommended, the additional $10 billion tax cut, with the moderate increases in the quality-of-life area, we can still have a balanced budget which I will submit to the Congress in January of 1978. We won\\'t wait one year or two years longer, as Governor Carter uh - indicates. As the economy improves, and it is improving, our gross national product this year will average about 6 percent increase over last year. We will have the lower rate of inflation for the uh - calendar year this year - something slightly under 6 percent. Employment will be up, revenues will be up. We\\'ll keep the lid on some of these programs that we can hold down as we have a little extra money to spend for those quality-of-life programs which I think are needed and necessary. Now I cannot, and would not, endorse the kind of program that uh - Governor Carter recommends. He endorses the Democratic uh - platform which, as I read it, calls for approximately sixty additional programs. We estimate that those programs would add a hundred billion dollars minimum and probably two hundred billion dollars - uhh maximum each year to the federal budget. Those programs you cannot afford and give tax relief. We feel that you can hold the line and restrain federal spending, give a tax reduction and still have a balanced budget by 1978.MR. NEWMAN: Governor Carter.MR. CARTER: Well, Mr. Ford takes the uh - same attitude that the Republicans always take. In the last three months before an election, they\\'re always for the programs that they always fight the other three-and-one-half years. Uh - I remember when uh - Herbert Hoover was against uh - jobs for people. I remember when Alf Landon was against Social Security and uh - later President Nixon, sixteen years ago, was telling the public that John Kennedy\\'s proposals would bankrupt the country and would double the cost. The best thing to do is to look at the record uh - of Mr. Ford\\'s Administration and Mr. Nixon\\'s before his. Uh - we had last year a $65 billion deficit - the largest deficit in the history of our country - more of a deficit spending than we had in the entire eight-year period under President Johnson and President Kennedy. We\\'ve got five hundred thousand more Americans out of jobs today than were out of work three months ago and since Mr. Ford\\'s been in office two years, we\\'ve had a 50 percent increase in unemployment from five million people out of work to two and a half million more people out of work and a total of seven and a half million. We\\'ve also got uh - a comparison between himself and Mr. Nixon. He\\'s got four times the size of the deficits that Mr. Nixon even had himself. This uh - talking about more people at work - uh is distorted because with a 14 percent increase in the cost of living in the last uh - two years, it means that - that women and young people have had to go to work when they didn\\'t want to because their fathers didn\\'t make enough to pay the increased cost of uh - food and uh housing and clothing. We have uh - in this last uh two years alone a hundred and twenty billion dollars total deficits under President Ford and uh - at the same time we\\'ve had, in the last eight years, a doubling in the number of bankruptcies for small business: we\\'ve had a negative growth in our - in our national economy measured in real dollars. The take-home pay of a worker in this country is actually less now than it was in 1968 - measured in real dollars. This is the kind of record that\\'s there and talk about the future and a drastic change or conversion on the part of Mr. Ford as of last minute is one that just doesn\\'t go.MR. NEWMAN: Mr. Reynolds.MR. REYNOLDS: Governor Carter, I\\'d like to turn uh - to what we used to call the energy crisis. Yesterday a British uh - government commission on air pollution, but one headed by a nuclear physicist, recommended that any further expansion of nuclear energy be delayed in Britain as long as possible. Now this is a subject that is quite controversial among our own people and there seems to be a clear difference between you and the President on the use of nuclear power plants, which you say you would use as a last priority. Why, sir, are they unsafe?MR. CARTER: Well among my other experiences in the past, I\\'ve - I\\'ve been a nuclear engineer, and did graduate work in this field. I think I know the - the uh capabilities and limitations of atomic power. But the energy - uh policy of our nation is one that uh has not yet been established under this administration. I think almost every other developed nation in the world has an energy policy except us. We have seen uh - the Federal Energy Agency established, for instance. Uh - in the crisis of 1973 it was supposed to be a temporary agency, uh now it\\'s permanent, it\\'s enormous, it\\'s growing every day. I think the Wall Street Journal uh reported not too long ago they have a hundred and twelve public relations experts working for the Federal Energy Agency to try to justify to the American people its own existence. We\\'ve got to have a - a firm way to handle the energy question. The reorganization proposal that I have put forward is one uh first step. In addition to that, we need to have - uh a realization that we\\'ve got uh about thirty-five years worth of oil left in the whole world. We\\'re gonna run out of oil. When Mr. Nixon made his famous uh speech on Operation Independence we were importing about 35 percent of our oil. Now we\\'ve increased that amount 25 percent. We now import about 44 percent of our oil. We need to shift from oil to coal. We need to concentrate our research and development effort on uh coal burning and extraction, with safer mines, but also it\\'s clean burning. We need to shift very strongly toward solar energy and have strict conservation measures. And then as a last resort only, continue to use atomic power. I would certainly uh - not cut out atomic power altogether. We can\\'t afford to give up that opportunity until later. But to the extent that we continue to use atomic power, I would be responsible as president to make sure that the safety precautions were initiated and maintained. For instance, some that have been forgotten; we need to have the reactor core - below ground level, the entire power plant that uses atomic uh - power tightly sealed and a heavy - heavy vacuum maintained. There ought to be a standardized design. There ought to be a full-time uh - atomic energy specialist, independent of the power company in the control room, full time, twenty-four hours a day, to shut down a plant if an abnormality develops. These kinds of uh - procedures, along with evacuation procedures, adequate insurance, ought to be initiated. So, shift from oil to coal, emphasize research and development on coal use and also on solar power, strict conservation measures, not yield every time that the special interest groups uh - put pressure on the president like uh this administration has done, and use atomic energy only as a last resort with the strictest possible safety precautions. That\\'s the best overall energy policy in the brief time we have to discuss it.MR. REYNOLDS: Well Governor, on that same subject, would you require mandatory conservation efforts to try to conserve fuel?MR. CARTER: Yes, I would. Some of the things that can be done about this is a change in the rate structure of electric power companies. We uh - now encourage people to waste electricity, and uh - by giving uh - the lowest rates to the biggest users. We don\\'t do anything to cut down on peak load requirements. We don\\'t have an adequate requirement for the insulation of homes, for the efficiency of automobiles. And whenever the uh - automobile manufacturers come forward and say they can\\'t meet the uh - amendments that the Congress has put forward, this Republican administration has delayed the implementation dates. In addition to that, we ought to have a - a shift toward the use of coal, particularly in the Appalachian regions where the coal is located. A lot of uh - very high quality, low-carbon coal, uh - low-sulfur coal is there, it\\'s where our employment is needed. Uh - this would - would help a great deal. So mandatory conservation measures - yes. Encouragement by the president for people to uh voluntarily conserve - yes. And also the private sector ought to be encouraged to - to bring forward to the public the benefits from efficiency. One bank in uh - Washington, fo- for instance, gives lower interest loans for people who adequately insulate their homes or who buy efficient automobiles. And some major uh - uh - manufacturing companies, like Dow Chemical, have through uh - very effective efficiency mechanism cut down the use of energy by uh - as much as 40 percent with the same out-product. These kinds of things uh - ought to be done, uh they ought to be encouraged and supported, and even required uh by the government, yes.MR. NEWMAN: President Ford.MR. FORD: Governor Carter skims over a very serious and a very broad subject. In January of uh - 1975 I submitted to the Congress and to the American people the first comprehensive energy program recommended by any president. It called for an increase in the production of energy in the United States. It called for uh - conservation measures so that we would save the energy that we have. If you\\'re going to increase domestic oil and gas production - and we have to - you have to give those producers an opportunity to uh - develop their land or their wells. I recommended to the Congress that we should increase production in this country from six hundred million tons a year to twel- a- a billion two hundred million tons by 1985. In order to do that we have to improve our extraction of coal from the ground; we have to improve our utilization of coal - make it more efficient, make it cleaner. In addition we uh - have to expand our research and development. In my program for energy independence we have increased, for example, solar energy research from about $84 million a year to about a hundred and twenty million dollars a year. We\\'re going as fast as the experts say we should. In nuclear power we have increased the research and development, uh - under the Energy Research and Development Agency uh - very substantially, to insure that our ener- uh - nuclear power plants are safer, that they are more efficient, and that we have adequate safeguards. I think you have to have greater oil and gas production, more coal production, more nuclear production, and in addition you have to have energy conservation.MR. NEWMAN: Mr. Gannon.MR. GANNON: Mr. President, I\\'d like to return for a moment to this problem of unemployment. You have vetoed or threatened to veto number of job bills passed or uh - in development in the Democratic Congress - Democratic-controlled Congress. Yet at the same time the government is paying out, uh - I think it is $17 billion, perhaps $20 billion a year in unemployment compensation caused by the high unemployment. Why do you think it is better to pay out unemployment compensation to idle people than to put them to work in public service jobs?MR. FORD: The bills that I vetoed, the one for an additional $6 billion, was not a bill that would have solved our unemployment problems. Even the proponents of it admitted that no more than four hundred thousand jobs would be uh - made available. Our analysis indicates that something in the magnitude of about one hundred fifty to two hundred thousand jobs would uh - be made available. Each one of those jobs would\\'ve cost the taxpayers $25 thousand. In addition, the jobs would not be available right now. They would not have materialized for about nine to eighteen months. The immediate problem we have is to stimulate our economy now so that we can get rid of unemployment. What we have done is to hold the lid on spending in an effort to reduce the rate of inflation. And we have proven, I think very conclusively, that you can reduce the rate of inflation and increase jobs. For example, as I have said, we have added some four million jobs in the last seventeen months. We have now employed eighty-eight million people in America, the largest number in the history of the United States. We\\'ve added five hundred thousand jobs in the last two months. Inflation is the quickest way to destroy jobs. And by holding the lid on federal spending we have been able to do an- a good job, an affirmative job in inflation and as a result have added to the jobs in this country. I think it\\'s uh - also appropriate to point out that through our tax policies we have stimulated uhh - added employment throughout the country, the investment tax credit, the tax incentives for expansion and modernization of our industrial capacity. It\\'s my - my opinion that the private sector, where five out of six jobs are, where you have permanent jobs, with the opportunity for advancement, is a better place than make-work jobs under the program recommended by the Congress.MR. GANNON: Just to follow up, Mr. President: the - the Congress has just passed a three point seven billion dollar appropriation bill which would provide money for the public works jobs program that you earlier tried to kill by your veto of the authorization legislation. In light of the fact that uh - unemployment again is rising - or has in the past three months - I wonder if you have rethought that question at all; whether you would consider uh - allowing this program to be funded, or will you veto that money bill?MR. FORD: Well, that bill has not yet come down to the Oval Office, so I am not in a position to make any judgment on it tonight. But that is an extra $4 billion that would uh - add to the deficit which would add to the inflationary pressures, which would help to destroy jobs in the private sector - not make jobs, where the jobs really are. These make-work, temporary jobs - dead end as they are - are not the kind of jobs that we want for our people. I think it\\'s interesting to point out that uh - in the uh - two years that I\\'ve been president I\\'ve vetoed fifty-six bills. Congress has sustained forty-two vetoes. As a result, we have saved over $9 billion in federal expenditures. And the Congress by overriding the bills that I did veto, the Congress has added some $13 billion to the federal expenditures and to the federal deficit. Now Governor Carter complains about the deficits that uh - uh - this administration has had. And yet he condemns the vetoes that I have made that has - that have saved the taxpayer $9 billion and could have saved an additional $13 billion. Now he can\\'t have it both ways. And therefore, it seems to me that we should hold the lid, as we have, to the best of our ability so we can stimulate the private economy and get the jobs where the jobs are - five out of six in this economy.MR. NEWMAN: Governor Carter.MR. CARTER: Well, Mr. Ford doesn\\'t seem to put into perspective the fact that when - when uh five hundred thousand more people are out of work than there were three months ago, while we have two and a half million more people out of work than were when he took office, that this touches human beings. I was in uh - a city in uh - Pennsylvania not too long ago, near here, and uh - there were about four or five thousand people in the audience - it was on a - on a train trip. And I said, \"How many uh - adults here are out of work?\" About a thousand raised their hands. Mr. Ford uh - actually has fewer people now in the private sector in non-farm jobs than when he took office. And still he talks about - uh success. Seven point nine percent unemployment is a terrible tragedy in this country. He says he\\'s learned how to match unemployment with inflation. That\\'s right. We\\'ve got the highest inflation we\\'ve had in twenty-five years right now, except under this administration, and that was fifty years ago. And we\\'ve got uh - the highest unemployment we\\'ve had uh - under Mr. Ford\\'s administration, since the Great Depression. This affects human beings, and - and his insensitivity in providing those people a chance to work has made this a welfare administration, and not a work administration. He hasn\\'t saved $9 billion with his vetoes. There\\'s only been uh - a net savings of $4 billion. And the cost in unemployment compensation, welfare compensation, and lost revenues has increased $23 billion in the last two years. This is a - a typical attitude that really causes havoc in people\\'s lives, and then it\\'s covered over by saying that our country has naturally got a 6 percent unemployment rate, or 7 percent unemployment rate and a 6 percent inflation. It\\'s a travesty. It shows a lack of leadership. And we\\'ve never had a president since the War between the States that vetoed more bills. Mr. Ford has vetoed four times as many bills as Mr. Nixon - per year. And eleven of \\'em have been overridden. One of his bills that was overridden - he only got one vote in the Senate and seven votes in the House, from Republicans.MR. NEWMAN: Governor Carter. So this shows a breakdown in leadership.MR. NEWMAN: Under the rules, I must stop you there. And Mrs. Drew.MS. DREW: Governor Carter, I\\'d like to come back to the subject of taxes. You have said that you want to cut taxes for the middle and lower income groups.MR. CARTER: Right.MS. DREW: But unless you\\'re willing to do such things as reduce the itemized deductions for charitable contributions or home mortgage payments, or interest, or taxes, or capital gains, you can\\'t really raise sufficient revenue to provide an overall tax cut of any size. So how are you gonna provide that tax relief that you\\'re talking about?MR. CARTER: Now we have uh such a grossly unbalanced tax system - as I said earlier, that it is a disgrace - ah of all the tax - benefits now, 25 percent of \\'em go to the 1 percent of the richest people in this country. Over 50 percent - 53 to be exact - percent of the tax benefits go to the 14 percent richest people in this country, and we\\'ve had a 50 percent increase in payroll deductions since Mr. Nixon went in office eight years ago. Mr. Ford has - has advocated since he\\'s been in office over $5 billion in reductions for corporations, special interest groups, and the very, very wealthy who derive their income - not from labor - but from investments. That\\'s got to be changed. A few things that can be done: we have now a deferral system so that the multinational corporations who invest overseas - if they make a million dollars in profits overseas - they don\\'t have to pay any of their taxes unless they bring their money back into this country. When they don\\'t pay their taxes, the average American pays the taxes for them. Not only that, but it robs this country of jobs, because instead of coming back with that million dollars and creating a shoe factory, say in New Hampshire or Vermont, if the company takes the money down to Italy and - and builds a shoe factory, they don\\'t have to pay any taxes on the money. Another thing is a system called DISC which was originally designed, proposed by Mr. Nixon, to encourage exports. This permits a company to create uh - a dummy corporation, to export their products, and then not to pay the full amount of taxes on them. This costs our uh - government about uh - $1.4 billion a year. And when those rich corporations don\\'t pay that tax, the average American taxpayer pays it for \\'em. Another one that\\'s uh - that\\'s very important is the uh - is the business deductions, uh - jet airplanes, uh - first class travel, the fifty-dollar martini lunch. The average working person can\\'t - uh - can\\'t take advantage of that, but the - the wealthier people - uh can. Uh - another system is where uhh - a dentist can invest money in say, raising cattle and uh - can put in a hundred thousand dollars of his own money, borrow nine hundred thousand dollars - nine hundred mi- thousand dollars - that makes a million - and mark off a great amount of uh - of loss uh - through that procedure. Uh - there was one example, for instance, where uh - somebody uh - produced pornographic movies. They put in $30 thousand of their own money and got a hundred and twenty thousand dollars in tax savings. Well, these special kinds of programs have - have robbed the average taxpayer and have benefited those who are powerful, and who can employ lobbyists, and who can have their CPAs and their lawyers to help them benefit from the roughly uh - eight thousand pages of the tax code. The average uh American person can\\'t do it. You can\\'t hire a lobbyist uh out of unemployment compensation checks.MS. DREW: Ah - Governor, to follow up on your answer. Uh - in order for any kind of tax relief to really be felt by the middle and lower-income peopleMR. CARTER: Yes. You need about, according to Congressional committees on this, you need about $10 billion. Now you listed some things - the uh - deferral on foreign income as estimated: that would save about $500 million. DISC, you said, was about 1.4 billion. uh - The estimate of the outside, if you eliminated all tax shelters, is 5 billion. So where else would you raise the revenue to provide this tax relief - would you, in fact, do away with all business deductions, and what other kinds of preferences would you do away with?MR. CARTER: No, I wouldn\\'t do away with all - uh business deductions. I think that would be a - a very serious mistake. But uh - if - if you could just do away with the ones that are unfair, you could lower taxes for everyone. I would never do anything that would increase the taxes for those who work for a living, or who are presently required to list all their income. What I wanna do is not to raise taxes, but to eliminate loopholes. And this is uh - the point of my first statistics that I gave you - that - that the present tax benefits that have been carved out over a long period of years - fifty years - by sharp tax lawyers and by lobbyists have benefited just the rich. These programs that I described to you earlier - the tax deferrals for overseas, the DISC, and the tax shelters, uh - they only apply to people in the $50 thousand-a-year bracket or up, and I think this is the very best way to approach it. It\\'s to make sure that everybody pays taxes on the income that they earn and make sure that you take whatever savings there is from the higher income levels and give it to the lower- and middle-income families.MR. NEWMAN: President Ford.MR. FORD: Governor Carter\\'s answer tonight does not coincide with the answer that he gave in an interview to the Associated Press a week or so ago. In that interview uh - Governor Carter indicated that uh - he would raise the taxes on those in the medium or middle-income brackets or higher. Now if you uh - take the medium or middle-income taxpayer - that\\'s about $14 thousand per person - uh - Governor Carter has indicated, publicly, in an interview that he would increase the taxes on about 50 percent of the working people of this country. I think uh - the way to get tax equity in this country is to give tax relief to the middle-income people who have an income from roughly $8 thousand up to twenty-five or thirty thousand dollars. They have been short-changed as we have taken ten million taxpayers off the tax rolls in the last eight years, and as we have uh - added to the minimum tax uh - provision to make all people pay more taxes. I believe in tax equity for the middle-income taxpayer, increasing the personal exemption. Mr. Carter wants to increase taxes for roughly half of the taxpayers of this country. Now, the Governor has also played a little fast and loose with the facts about vetoes. The records show that President Roosevelt vetoed an average of fifty-five bills a year. President Truman vetoed on the average, while he was president, about thirty-eight bills a year. I understand that Governor Carter, when he was Governor of Georgia, vetoed between thirty-five and forty bills a year. My average in two years is twenty-six. But in the process of that we have saved uhh - $9 billion. And one final comment, uh - Governor Carter talks about the tax bills and all of the inequities that exist in the present law. I must remind him the Democrats have controlled the Congress for the last twenty-two years and they wrote all the tax bills.MR. NEWMAN: Mr. Reynolds.MR. REYNOLDS: I suspect that uhh - we could continue on this tax argument for some time. But I\\'d like to move on to another area. Mr. President, uh everybody seems to be running against Washington this year. And I\\'d like to raise two coincidental events and ask you whether you think perhaps this may have a bearing on the attitude throughout the country. The House Ethics Committee has just now ended its investigation of Daniel Schorr, after several months and many thousands of dollars, trying to find out how he obtained and caused to be published a report of the Congress that probably is the property of the American people. At the same time. the Senate Select Committee on Standards and Conduct has voted not really to begin an investigation of a United States senator because of allegations against him that he may have been receiving corporate funds illegally over a period of years. Do you suppose, sir, that events like this contribute to the feeling in the country that maybe there\\'s something wrong in Washington, and I don\\'t mean just in the executive branch but throughout the whole government?MR. FORD: There is a considerable anti-Washington feeling throughout the country. But I think the feeling is misplaced. In the last two years, we have restored integrity in the White House, and we\\'ve set high standards in the executive branch of the government. The anti-Washington feeling, in my opinion, ought to be focused on the Congress of the United States. For example, this Congress, very shortly, will spend a billion dollars a year for its housekeeping, its salaries, its expenses and the like. It - the next Congress will probably be the first billion-dollar Congress in the history of the United States. I don\\'t think the American people are getting their money\\'s worth from the majority party that run this Congress. We, in addition, see that uh - in the last uh - four years the number of employees hired by the Congress has gone up substantial- uh much more than uh - the gross national product, much more than any other increase throughout our society. Congress is hiring people by the droves, and the cast as a result has gone up. And I don\\'t see any improvement in the performance of the Congress under the present leadership. So it seems to me instead of the anti-Washington feeling being aimed at everybody in Washington, it seems to me that the focus should be where the problem is, which is the Congress of the United States, and particularly the majority in the Congress. They spend too much money on themselves. They have too many employees. There\\'s some question about their morality. It seems to me that in this election, the focus should not be on the executive branch but the corrections should come as the voters vote for their members of the House of Representatives or for their United States senator. That\\'s where the problem is and I hope there\\'ll be some corrective action taken so we can get some new leadership in the Congress of the United States.MR. REYNOLDS: Mr. President, if I may follow up. Uh - I think you\\'ve made it plain that you take a dim view of the uh - majority in the Congress. Isn\\'t it quite likely, sir, that you will have a Democratic Congress in the next session, if you are elected president? And hasn\\'t the country uh - a right to ask whether you can get along with that Congress, or whether we\\'ll have continued confrontation?MR. FORD: Well, It seems to me that uh - we have a chance - the Republicans - to get a majority in the House of Representatives. We will make some gains in the United States Senate. So there will be different ratios in the House, as well as in the Senate, and as president I will be able to uh - work with that Congress. But let me take the other side of the coin, if I might. Supposing we had - had a Democratic Congress for the last two years and we\\'d had uh - Governor Carter as President. He has, in effect, said that he would agree with all of - he would disapprove of the vetoes that I have made, and would have added significantly to expenditures and the deficit in the federal government. I think it would be contrary to one of the basic concepts in our system of government - a system of checks and balances. We have a Democratic Congress today, and fortunately we\\'ve had a Republican president to check their excesses with my vetoes. If we have a Democratic Congress next year, and a president who wants to spend an additional one hundred billion dollars a year, or maybe two hundred billion dollars a year, with more programs, we will have in my judgment, greater deficits with more spending, more dangers of inflation. I think the American people want a Republican president to check on any excesses that come out of the next Congress, if it is a Democratic Congress.MR. NEWMAN: Governor Carter.MR. CARTER: Well, it\\'s not a matter of uh - Republican and Democrat. It\\'s a matter of leadership or no leadership. President Eisenhower worked with a Democratic Congress very well. Even President Nixon, because he was a strong leader at least, worked with a Democratic Congress very well. Uh - Mr. Ford has vetoed, as I said earlier, four times as many bills per year as Mr. Nixon. Mr. Ford quite often puts forward a program just as a public relations stunt, and never tries to put it through the Congress by working with the Congress. I think under presidents For- uh - Nixon and Eisenhower they passed about 60 to 75 percent of their legislation. This year Mr. Ford will not pass more than 26 percent of all the legislative proposals he puts forward. This is government by stalemate, and we\\'ve seen almost a complete breakdown in the proper relationship between the president, who represents this country, and the Congress, who collectively also represent this country. We\\'ve had uh - Republican presidents before who\\'ve tried to run against a Democratic - uh Congress. And I don\\'t think it\\'s uh - the Congress is Mr. Ford\\'s opponent; but if uh - if - if he insists that uh - that I be responsible for the Democratic Congress, of which I\\'m - have not been a part, then I think it\\'s only fair that he be responsible for the Nixon administration in its entirety, of which he was a part. That, I think, is a good balance. But the point is, that - that a president ought to lead this country. Mr. Ford, so far as I know, except for avoiding another Watergate, has not accomplished one single major program for this country. And there\\'s been a constant squabbling between the president and the Congress, and that\\'s not the way this country ought to be run. I might go back to one other thing. Mr. Ford has uh - misquoted an AP uh - news story that was in error to begin with. That story reported several times that I would lower taxes for low and middle-income families and uh - that correction was delivered to the White House and I am sure that the president knows about this uh - correction, but he still insists uh - on repeating an erroneous statement.MR. NEWMAN: President Ford, Governor Carter, we no longer have enough time for two complete sequences of questions. We have only about six minutes left for questions and answers. For that reason we will drop the follow-up questions at this point but each candidate will still be able to respond to the other\\'s answers. Uh - to the extent that you can, gentlemen, please keep your remarks brief. Mr. Gannon.MR. GANNON: Governor Carter, one uh - important uh - part of the Government\\'s economic policy uh - apparatus we haven\\'t talked about is the Federal Reserve Board. I\\'d like to ask you something about what you\\'ve said and that is that uh - you believe that a president ought to have a chairman of the Federal Reserve Board whose views are compatible with his own. Based on the record of the last few years, would you say that your views are compatible with those of Chairman Arthur Burns? And if not, would you seek his resignation if you are elected?MR. CARTER: What I have said is that the president ought to have a chance to appoint a chairman of the Federal Reserve Board to have a coterminous uh term; in other words, both of \\'em serve the same four - four years. The Congress can modify the supply of money by modifying the income uh tax laws. The president can modify the uh - economic structure of a country by public statements and general attitudes in the budget that he proposes. The Federal Reserve has uh - an independent status that ought to be preserved; I think that Mr. uh - Burns did take a typical, erroneous Republican attitude in the 1973 year when inflation was so high. They assumed that the uh - inflation rate was because of excessive demand and uh - therefore put into effect tight constraint on the economy, very high interest rates, which is typical also of the Republican administration, uh - tried to increase the uh - the tax uh - payments by individuals, and cut the tax payments by corporations. I would have uh - done it opposite. I think the uh - problem should\\'ve been addressed by increasing productivity, by having uh - put - put people back to work so they could purchase more goods, lower income taxes on individuals, perhaps raise them, if necessary, on corporations in comparison. But uh - Mr. Burns uh - in that respect made a very serious mistake. I would not wanna destroy the - the independence of the uh Federal Reserve - uh Board. But I do think we ought to have a cohesive economic policy with at - at least the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board and the president\\'s terms being uh - the same and letting the Congress, of course, be the third uh - entity with uh - with independence subject only to the president\\'s veto.MR. NEWMAN: President Ford, your response.MR. FORD: The chairman of the Federal Reserve Board should be independent. Fortunately, he has been during Democratic as well as Republican administrations. As the result in the last uh - two years uh - we have had a responsible monetary policy. Uh the Federal Reserve Board indicated that the supply of money would be held between four to four and a half and seven and seven and a half. They have done a good job in integrating the money supply with the uh - fiscal policy of the uh - executive and legislative branches of the government. It would be catastrophic if the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board became the tool of the political uh - party that was in power. It\\'s important for our future uhh - economic security that that job be nonpolitical and uh - separate from the executive and the Legislative branches.MR. NEWMAN: Mrs. Drew.MS. DREW: Uh Mr. President, the real problem with the FBI and, in fact, all of the intelligence agencies is there are no real laws governing them. Such laws as there are tend to be vague and open-ended. Now, you have issued some executive orders, but we\\'ve learned that leaving these agencies to executive discretion and direction can get them and, in fact, the country in a great deal of trouble. One president may be a decent man, the next one might not be. So, what do you think about trying to write in some more protection by getting some laws governing these agencies?MR. FORD: You are familiar, of course, with the fact that I am the first president in thirty years who has reorganized the intelligence agencies in the federal government: the CIA, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency and the others. We\\'ve done that by executive order. Uhh - and I think uh - we\\'ve tightened it up; we\\'ve uh - straightened out their problems that developed over the last few years. It doesn\\'t seem to me that it\\'s needed or necessary to have legislation in this particular regard. Uhh - I have recommended to the Congress, however - I\\'m sure you\\'re familiar with this - legislation that would uhh - make it uhh - very uhh - proper in - in the right way, that the attorney general could go in and get the right for wiretapping under security cases. This was an effort that was made by the attorney general and myself, working with the Congress. But even in this area, where I think new legislation would be justified, uh the Congress has not responded. So, I feel in that case, as well as in the reorganization of the intelligence agencies, as I\\'ve done, we have to do it by executive order. And I\\'m glad that we have a good director in George Bush. We have good executive orders, and the CIA and the DIA and NASA uh - uh - NSA are now doing a good job under proper supervision.MR. NEWMAN: Governor Carter.MR. CARTER: Well, one of the very serious things that\\'s happened in our government in recent years, and has continued up until now, is a breakdown in the trust among our people in the [twenty-seven-minute delay]MR. NEWMAN: failure in the broadcasting of the debate, it occurred twenty-seven minutes ago. Uh the fault has been dealt with and uh - we want to thank President Ford and Governor Carter for being so patient and understanding while this uh delay went on. Uh we very much regret the technical failure that lost the sound as it - as it was leaving this theater. It occurred during uh Governor Carter\\'s response to what would have been and what was the last question put to the candidates. That question went to President Ford. It dealt with the control of government intelligence agencies. Uh Governor Carter was making that response and had very nearly finished it. Uh - he wil1 conclude his response now after which uh - President Ford and Governor Carter will make their closing statements. Governor.MR. CARTER: There has been too much government secrecy and not uh - not enough respect for the personal privacy of American citizens.MR. NEWMAN: It is now time for the closing statements, which are to be up to four minutes long. Governor Carter, by the same toss of the coin that directed the first question to you, you are to go first now.MR. CARTER: Well, tonight we\\'ve had a chance to talk a lot about the past. But I think it\\'s time to talk about the future. Our nation in the last eight years has been divided as never before. It\\'s a time for unity. It\\'s a time to draw ourselves together: to have a president and a Congress that can work together with mutual respect for a change, cooperating for a change, in the open for a change, so the people can understand their own government. It\\'s time for government, industry, labor, manufacturing, agriculture, education, other entities in our society to cooperate. And it\\'s a time for government to understand and to cooperate with our people. For a long time our American citizens have been excluded, sometimes misled, sometimes have been lied to. This is uh - not compatible with the purpose of our nation. I believe in our country. It needs to be competent. The government needs to be well-managed, efficient, economical, We need to have a government that\\'s sensitive to our people\\'s needs - to those who are poor, who don\\'t have adequate health care, who have been cheated too long with our tax programs, who\\'ve been out of jobs, whose families have been torn apart. We need to restore the faith and the trust of the American people in their own government. In addition to that, we\\'ve suffered because we haven\\'t had leadership in this administration. We\\'ve got a government of stalemate. We\\'ve lost the vision of what our country can and ought to be. This is not the America that we\\'ve known in the past. It\\'s not the America that we have to have in the future. I don\\'t claim to know all the answers. But I\\'ve got confidence in my country. Our economic strength is still there. Our system of government - in spite of Vietnam, Cambodia, CIA, Watergate - is still the best system of government on earth. And the greatest resource of all are the two hundred and fifteen million Americans who have within us the strength, the character, the intelligence, the experience, the patriotism, the idealism, the compassion, the sense of brotherhood on which we can rely in the future to restore the greatness to our country We ought not to be excluded from our government anymore. We need a president who can go in - who derives his strength from the people. I owe the special interests nothing. I owe everything to you, the people of this country. And I believe that we can bind our wounds. I believe that we can work together. And I believe that if we can tap the tremendous untapped reservoir of innate strength in this country, that we can once again have a government as good as our people, and let the world know what we still know and hope for - that we still live in the greatest and the strongest and the best country on earth.MR. NEWMAN: President Ford.MR. FORD: On November second all of you will make a very, very important decision. One of the major issues in this campaign is trust. A president should never promise more than he can deliver and a president should always deliver everything that he\\'s promised. A president can\\'t be all things to all people. A president should be the same thing to all people. Another issue in this campaign, Governor Carter has endorsed the Democratic platform, which calls for more spending, bigger deficits, more inflation or mare taxes. Governor Carter has embraced the record of the present Congress, dominated by his political party. It calls for more of the same. Governor Carter in his acceptance speech called for more and more programs, which means more and more government. I think the real issue in this campaign, and that which you must decide on November second, is whether you should vote for his promise or my performance in two years in the White House. On the fourth of July we had a wonderful two hundredth birthday - for our great country. It was a superb occasion. It was a glorious day. In the first century of our nation\\'s history our forefathers gave us the finest form of government in the history of mankind. In the second century of our nation\\'s history, our forefathers developed the most productive industrial nation in the history of the globe. Our third century should be the century of individual freedom for all our two hundred and fifteen million Americans today and all that join us. In the last few years government has gotten bigger and bigger; industry has gotten larger and larger; labor unions have gotten bigger and bigger; and our children have been the victims of mass education. We must make this next century the century of the individual. We should never forget that a government big enough to give us everything we want is a government big enough to take from us everything we have. The individual worker in the plants throughout the United States should not be a small cog in a big machine. The member of a labor union must have his rights strengthened and broadened and our children in their education should have an opportunity to improve themselves based on their talents and their abilities. My mother and father, during the Depression, worked very hard to give me an opportunity to do better in our great country. Your mothers and fathers did the same thing for you and others. Betty and I have worked very hard to give our children a brighter future in the United States, our beloved country. You and others in this great country have worked hard and done a great deal to give your children and your grandchildren the blessings of a better America. I believe we can all work together to make the individuals in the future have more and all of us working together can build a better America.MR. NEWMAN: Thank you President Ford. Thank you Governor Carter. Our thanks also to the questioners and to the audience in this theater. Ahh - we much regret the technical failure that caused a twenty-eight-minute delay in the broadcast of the debate. We believe, however, that everyone will agree that it did not detract from the effectiveness of the debate or from its fairness. The next presidential debate is to take place on Wednesday, October sixth, in San Francisco at nine-thirty P. M., Eastern Daylight Time. The topics are to be foreign and defense issues. As with all three debates between the presidential candidates and the one between the vice-presidential candidates, it is being arranged by the League of Women Voters Education Fund in the hope of promoting a wider and better informed participation by the American people in the election in November. Now, from the Walnut Street Theater in Philadelphia, good night.',\n",
       " 'September 26, 1960 Debate TranscriptSeptember 26, 1960The First Kennedy-Nixon Presidential DebateHOWARD K. SMITH, MODERATOR: Good evening. The television and radio stations of the United States and their affiliated stations are proud to provide facilities for a discussion of issues in the current political campaign by the two major candidates for the presidency. The candidates need no introduction. The Republican candidate, Vice President Richard M. Nixon, and the Democratic candidate, Senator John F. Kennedy. According to rules set by the candidates themselves, each man shall make an opening statement of approximately eight minutes\\' duration and a closing statement of approximately three minutes\\' duration. In between the candidates will answer, or comment upon answers to questions put by a panel of correspondents. In this, the first discussion in a series of four uh - joint appearances, the subject-matter has been agreed, will be restricted to internal or domestic American matters. And now for the first opening statement by Senator John F. Kennedy.SENATOR KENNEDY: Mr. Smith, Mr. Nixon. In the election of 1860, Abraham Lincoln said the question was whether this nation could exist half-slave or half-free. In the election of 1960, and with the world around us, the question is whether the world will exist half-slave or half-free, whether it will move in the direction of freedom, in the direction of the road that we are taking, or whether it will move in the direction of slavery. I think it will depend in great measure upon what we do here in the United States, on the kind of society that we build, on the kind of strength that we maintain. We discuss tonight domestic issues, but I would not want that to be any implication to be given that this does not involve directly our struggle with Mr. Khrushchev for survival. Mr. Khrushchev is in New York, and he maintains the Communist offensive throughout the world because of the productive power of the Soviet Union itself. The Chinese Communists have always had a large population. But they are important and dangerous now because they are mounting a major effort within their own country. The kind of country we have here, the kind of society we have, the kind of strength we build in the United States will be the defense of freedom. If we do well here, if we meet our obligations, if we\\'re moving ahead, then I think freedom will be secure around the world. If we fail, then freedom fails. Therefore, I think the question before the American people is: Are we doing as much as we can do? Are we as strong as we should be? Are we as strong as we must be if we\\'re going to maintain our independence, and if we\\'re going to maintain and hold out the hand of friendship to those who look to us for assistance, to those who look to us for survival? I should make it very clear that I do not think we\\'re doing enough, that I am not satisfied as an American with the progress that we\\'re making. This is a great country, but I think it could be a greater country; and this is a powerful country, but I think it could be a more powerful country. I\\'m not satisfied to have fifty percent of our steel-mill capacity unused. I\\'m not satisfied when the United States had last year the lowest rate of economic growth of any major industrialized society in the world. Because economic growth means strength and vitality; it means we\\'re able to sustain our defenses; it means we\\'re able to meet our commitments abroad. I\\'m not satisfied when we have over nine billion dollars worth of food - some of it rotting - even though there is a hungry world, and even though four million Americans wait every month for a food package from the government, which averages five cents a day per individual. I saw cases in West Virginia, here in the United States, where children took home part of their school lunch in order to feed their families because I don\\'t think we\\'re meeting our obligations toward these Americans. I\\'m not satisfied when the Soviet Union is turning out twice as many scientists and engineers as we are. I\\'m not satisfied when many of our teachers are inadequately paid, or when our children go to school part-time shifts. I think we should have an educational system second to none. I\\'m not satisfied when I see men like Jimmy Hoffa - in charge of the largest union in the United States - still free. I\\'m not satisfied when we are failing to develop the natural resources of the United States to the fullest. Here in the United States, which developed the Tennessee Valley and which built the Grand Coulee and the other dams in the Northwest United States at the present rate of hydropower production - and that is the hallmark of an industrialized society - the Soviet Union by 1975 will be producing more power than we are. These are all the things, I think, in this country that can make our society strong, or can mean that it stands still. I\\'m not satisfied until every American enjoys his full constitutional rights. If a Negro baby is born - and this is true also of Puerto Ricans and Mexicans in some of our cities - he has about one-half as much chance to get through high school as a white baby. He has one-third as much chance to get through college as a white student. He has about a third as much chance to be a professional man, about half as much chance to own a house. He has about uh - four times as much chance that he\\'ll be out of work in his life as the white baby. I think we can do better. I don\\'t want the talents of any American to go to waste. I know that there are those who want to turn everything over to the government. I don\\'t at all. I want the individuals to meet their responsibilities. And I want the states to meet their responsibilities. But I think there is also a national responsibility. The argument has been used against every piece of social legislation in the last twenty-five years. The people of the United States individually could not have developed the Tennessee Valley; collectively they could have. A cotton farmer in Georgia or a peanut farmer or a dairy farmer in Wisconsin and Minnesota, he cannot protect himself against the forces of supply and demand in the market place; but working together in effective governmental programs he can do so. Seventeen million Americans, who live over sixty-five on an average Social Security check of about seventy-eight dollars a month, they\\'re not able to sustain themselves individually, but they can sustain themselves through the social security system. I don\\'t believe in big government, but I believe in effective governmental action. And I think that\\'s the only way that the United States is going to maintain its freedom. It\\'s the only way that we\\'re going to move ahead. I think we can do a better job. I think we\\'re going to have to do a better job if we are going to meet the responsibilities which time and events have placed upon us. We cannot turn the job over to anyone else. If the United States fails, then the whole cause of freedom fails. And I think it depends in great measure on what we do here in this country. The reason Franklin Roosevelt was a good neighbor in Latin America was because he was a good neighbor in the United States. Because they felt that the American society was moving again. I want us to recapture that image. I want people in Latin America and Africa and Asia to start to look to America; to see how we\\'re doing things; to wonder what the resident of the United States is doing; and not to look at Khrushchev, or look at the Chinese Communists. That is the obligation upon our generation. In 1933, Franklin Roosevelt said in his inaugural that this generation of Americans has a rendezvous with destiny. I think our generation of Americans has the same rendezvous. The question now is: Can freedom be maintained under the most severe tack - attack it has ever known? I think it can be. And I think in the final analysis it depends upon what we do here. I think it\\'s time America started moving again.MR. SMITH: And now the opening statement by Vice President Richard M. Nixon.MR. NIXON: Mr. Smith, Senator Kennedy. The things that Senator Kennedy has said many of us can agree with. There is no question but that we cannot discuss our internal affairs in the United States without recognizing that they have a tremendous bearing on our international position. There is no question but that this nation cannot stand still; because we are in a deadly competition, a competition not only with the men in the Kremlin, but the men in Peking. We\\'re ahead in this competition, as Senator Kennedy, I think, has implied. But when you\\'re in a race, the only way to stay ahead is to move ahead. And I subscribe completely to the spirit that Senator Kennedy has expressed tonight, the spirit that the United States should move ahead. Where, then, do we disagree? I think we disagree on the implication of his remarks tonight and on the statements that he has made on many occasions during his campaign to the effect that the United States has been standing still. We heard tonight, for example, the statement made that our growth in national product last year was the lowest of any industrial nation in the world. Now last year, of course, was 1958. That happened to be a recession year. But when we look at the growth of G.N.P. this year, a year of recovery, we find that it\\'s six and nine-tenths per cent and one of the highest in the world today. More about that later. Looking then to this problem of how the United States should move ahead and where the United States is moving, I think it is well that we take the advice of a very famous campaigner: Let\\'s look at the record. Is the United States standing still? Is it true that this Administration, as Senator Kennedy has charged, has been an Administration of retreat, of defeat, of stagnation? Is it true that, as far as this country is concerned, in the field of electric power, in all of the fields that he has mentioned, we have not been moving ahead. Well, we have a comparison that we can make. We have the record of the Truman Administration of seven and a half years and the seven and a half years of the Eisenhower Administration. When we compare these two records in the areas that Senator Kennedy has - has discussed tonight, I think we find that America has been moving ahead. Let\\'s take schools. We have built more schools in these last seven and a half years than we built in the previous seven and a half, for that matter in the previous twenty years. Let\\'s take hydroelectric power. We have developed more hydroelectric power in these seven and a half years than was developed in any previous administration in history. Let us take hospitals. We find that more have been built in this Administration than in the previous Administration. The same is true of highways. Let\\'s put it in terms that all of us can understand. We often hear gross national product discussed and in that respect may I say that when we compare the growth in this Administration with that of the previous Administration that then there was a total growth of eleven percent over seven years; in this Administration there has been a total growth of nineteen per cent over seven years. That shows that there\\'s been more growth in this Administration than in its predecessor. But let\\'s not put it there; let\\'s put it in terms of the average family. What has happened to you? We find that your wages have gone up five times as much in the Eisenhower Administration as they did in the Truman Administration. What about the prices you pay? We find that the prices you pay went up five times as much in the Truman Administration as they did in the Eisenhower Administration. What\\'s the net result of this? This means that the average family income went up fifteen per cent in the Eisenhower years as against two per cent in the Truman years. Now, this is not standing still. But, good as this record is, may I emphasize it isn\\'t enough. A record is never something to stand on. It\\'s something to build on. And in building on this record, I believe that we have the secret for progress, we know the way to progress. And I think, first of all, our own record proves that we know the way. Senator Kennedy has suggested that he believes he knows the way. I respect the sincerity which he m- which he makes that suggestion. But on the other hand, when we look at the various programs that he offers, they do not seem to be new. They seem to be simply retreads of the programs of the Truman Administration which preceded it. And I would suggest that during the course of the evening he might indicate those areas in which his programs are new, where they will mean more progress than we had then. What kind of programs are we for? We are for programs that will expand educational opportunities, that will give to all Americans their equal chance for education, for all of the things which are necessary and dear to the hearts of our people. We are for programs, in addition, which will see that our medical care for the aged are - is - are much - is much better handled than it is at the present time. Here again, may I indicate that Senator Kennedy and I are not in disagreement as to the aims. We both want to help the old people. We want to see that they do have adequate medical care. The question is the means. I think that the means that I advocate will reach that goal better than the means that he advocates. I could give better examples, but for - for whatever it is, whether it\\'s in the field of housing, or health, or medical care, or schools, or the eh- development of electric power, we have programs which we believe will move America, move her forward and build on the wonderful record that we have made over these past seven and a half years. Now, when we look at these programs, might I suggest that in evaluating them we often have a tendency to say that the test of a program is how much you\\'re spending. I will concede that in all the areas to which I have referred Senator Kennedy would have the spe- federal government spend more than I would have it spend. I costed out the cost of the Democratic platform. It runs a minimum of thirteen and two-tenths billions dollars a year more than we are presently spending to a maximum of eighteen billion dollars a year more than we\\'re presently spending. Now the Republican platform will cost more too. It will cost a minimum of four billion dollars a year more, a maximum of four and nine-tenths billion dollar a year more than we\\'re presently spending. Now, does this mean that his program is better than ours? Not at all. Because it isn\\'t a question of how much the federal government spends; it isn\\'t a question of which government does the most. It is a question of which administration does the right thing. And in our case, I do believe that our programs will stimulate the creative energies of a hundred and eighty million free Americans. I believe the programs that Senator Kennedy advocates will have a tendency to stifle those creative energies, I believe in other words, that his program would lead to the stagnation of the motive power that we need in this country to get progress. The final point that I would like to make is this: Senator Kennedy has suggested in his speeches that we lack compassion for the poor, for the old, and for others that are unfortunate. Let us understand throughout this campaign that his motives and mine are sincere. I know what it means to be poor. I know what it means to see people who are unemployed. I know Senator Kennedy feels as deeply about these problems as I do, but our disagreement is not about the goals for America but only about the means to reach those goals.MR. SMITH: Thank you, Mr. Nixon. That completes the opening statements, and now the candidates will answer questions or comment upon one another\\'s answers to questions, put by correspondents of the networks. The correspondents: [introducing themselves: \"I\\'m Sander Vanocur, NBC News;\" \"I\\'m Charles Warren, Mutual News;\" \"I\\'m Stuart Novins, CBS News;\" \"Bob Fleming, ABC News.\"] The first question to Senator Kennedy from Mr. Fleming.MR. FLEMING: Senator, the Vice President in his campaign has said that you were naive and at times immature. He has raised the question of leadership. On this issue, why do you think people should vote for you rather than the Vice President?MR. KENNEDY: Well, the Vice President and I came to the Congress together 1946; we both served in the Labor Committee. I\\'ve been there now for fourteen years, the same period of time that he has, so that our experience in uh - government is comparable. Secondly, I think the question is uh - what are the programs that we advocate, what is the party record that we lead? I come out of the Democratic party, which in this century has produced Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman, and which supported and sustained these programs which I\\'ve discussed tonight. Mr. Nixon comes out of the Republican party. He was nominated by it. And it is a fact that through most of these last twenty-five years the Republican leadership has opposed federal aid for education, medical care for the aged, development of the Tennessee Valley, development of our natural resources. I think Mr. Nixon is an effective leader of his party. I hope he would grant me the same. The question before us is: which point of view and which party do we want to lead the United States?MR. SMITH: Mr. Nixon, would you like to comment on that statement?Mr. NIXON: I have no comment.Mr. SMITH: The next question: Mr. Novins.MR. NOVINS: Mr. Vice President, your campaign stresses the value of your eight year experience, and the question arises as to whether that experience was as an observer or as a participant or as an initiator of policy-making. Would you tell us please specifically what major proposals you have made in the last eight years that have been adopted by the Administration?MR. NIXON: It would be rather difficult to cover them in eight and- in two and a half minutes. I would suggest that these proposals could be mentioned. First, after each of my foreign trips I have made recommendations that have been adopted. For example, after my first trip abroad - abroad, I strongly recommended that we increase our exchange programs particularly as they related to exchange of persons of leaders in the labor field and in the information field. After my trip to South America, I made recommendations that a separate inter-American lending agency be set up which the South American nations would like much better than a lend- than to participate in the lending agencies which treated all the countries of the world the same. Uh - I have made other recommendations after each of the other trips; for example, after my trip abroad to Hungary I made some recommendations with regard to the Hungarian refugee situation which were adopted, not only by the President but some of them were enacted into law by the Congress. Within the Administration, as a chairman of the President\\'s Committee on Price Stability and Economic Growth, I have had the opportunity to make recommendations which have been adopted within the Administration and which I think have been reasonably effective. I know Senator Kennedy suggested in his speech at Cleveland yesterday that that committee had not been particularly effective. I would only suggest that while we do not take the credit for it - I would not presume to - that since that committee has been formed the price line has been held very well within the United States.MR. KENNEDY: Well, I would say in the latter that the - and that\\'s what I found uh - somewhat unsatisfactory about the figures uh - Mr. Nixon, that you used in your previous speech, when you talked about the Truman Administration. You - Mr. Truman came to office in nineteen uh - forty-four and at the end of the war, and uh - difficulties that were facing the United States during that period of transition - 1946 when price controls were lifted - so it\\'s rather difficult to use an overall figure taking those seven and a half years and comparing them to the last eight years. I prefer to take the overall percentage record of the last twenty years of the Democrats and the eight years of the Republicans to show an overall period of growth. In regard to uh - price stability uh - I\\'m not aware that that committee did produce recommendations that ever were certainly before the Congress from the point of view of legislation in regard to controlling prices. In regard to the exchange of students and labor unions, I am chairman of the subcommittee on Africa and I think that one of the most unfortunate phases of our policy towards that country was the very minute number of exchanges that we had. I think it\\'s true of Latin America also. We did come forward with a program of students for the Congo of over three hundred which was more than the federal government had for all of Africa the previous year, so that I don\\'t think that uh - we have moved at least in those two areas with sufficient vigor.MR. SMITH: The next question to Senator Kennedy from Mr. Warren.MR. WARREN: Uh - Senator Kennedy, during your brief speech a few minutes ago you mentioned farm surpluses.MR. KENNEDY: That\\'s correct.MR. WARREN: I\\'d like to ask this: It\\'s a fact, I think, that presidential candidates traditionally make promises to farmers. Lots of people, I think, don\\'t understand why the government pays farmers for not producing certain crops or paying farmers if they overproduce for that matter. Now, let me ask, sir, why can\\'t the farmer operate like the business man who operates a factory? If an auto company overproduces a certain model car Uncle Sam doesn\\'t step in and buy up the surplus. Why this constant courting of the farmer?MR. KENNEDY: Well, because I think that if the federal government moved out of the program and withdrew its supports uh - then I think you would have complete uh - economic chaos. The farmer plants in the spring and harvests in the fall. There are hundreds of thousands of them. They really don\\'t - they\\'re not able to control their market very well. They bring their crops in or their livestock in, many of them about the same time. They have only a few purchasers that buy their milk or their hogs - a few large companies in many cases - and therefore the farmer is not in a position to bargain very effectively in the market place. I think the experience of the twenties has shown what a free market could do to agriculture. And if the agricultural economy collapses, then the economy of the rest of the United States sooner or later will collapse. The farmers are the number one market for the automobile industry of the United States. The automobile industry is the number one market for steel. So if the farmers\\' economy continues to decline as sharply as it has in recent years, then I think you would have a recession in the rest of the country. So I think the case for the government intervention is a good one. Secondly, my objection to present farm policy is that there are no effective controls to bring supply and demand into better balance. The dropping of the support price in order to limit production does not work, and we now have the highest uh - surpluses - nine billion dollars worth. We\\'ve had a uh - higher tax load from the Treasury for the farmer in the last few years with the lowest farm income in many years. I think that this farm policy has failed. In my judgment the only policy that will work will be for effective supply and demand to be in balance. And that can only be done through governmental action. I therefore suggest that in those basic commodities which are supported, that the federal government, after endorsement by the farmers in that commodity, attempt to bring supply and demand into balance - attempt effective production controls - so that we won\\'t have that five or six per cent surplus which breaks the price fifteen or twenty per cent. I think Mr. Benson\\'s program has failed. And I must say, after reading the Vice President\\'s speech before the farmers, as he read mine, I don\\'t believe that it\\'s very much different from Mr. Benson\\'s. I don\\'t think it provides effective governmental controls. I think the support prices are tied to the average market price of the last three years, which was Mr. Benson\\'s theory. I therefore do not believe that this is a sharp enough breach with the past to give us any hope of success for the future.MR. SMITH: Mr. Nixon, comment?MR. NIXON; I of course disagree with Senator Kennedy insofar as his suggestions as to what should be done uh - with re- on the farm program. He has made the suggestion that what we need is to move in the direction of more government controls, a suggestion that would also mean raising prices uh - that the consumers pay for products and im- and imposing upon the farmers uh - controls on acreage even far more than they have today. I think this is the wrong direction. I don\\'t think this has worked in the past; I do not think it will work in the future. The program that I have advocated is one which departs from the present program that we have in this respect. It recognizes that the government has a responsibility to get the farmer out of the trouble he presently is in because the government got him into it. And that\\'s the fundamental reason why we can\\'t let the farmer go by himself at the present time. The farmer produced these surpluses because the government asked him to through legislation during the war. Now that we have these surpluses, it\\'s our responsibility to indemnify the farmer during that period that we get rid of the farmer uh - the surpluses. Until we get the surpluses off the farmer\\'s back, however, we should have a program such as I announced, which will see that farm income holds up. But I would propose holding that income up not through a type of program that Senator Kennedy has suggested that would raise prices, but one that would indemnify the farmer, pay the farmer in kind uh - from the products which are in surplus.Mr. SMITH: The next question to Vice President Nixon from Mr. Vanocur.MR. VANOCUR: Uh - Mr. Vice President, since the question of executive leadership is a very important campaign issue, I\\'d like to follow Mr. Novins\\' question. Now, Republican campaign slogans - you\\'ll see them on signs around the country as you did last week - say it\\'s experience that counts - that\\'s over a picture of yourself; sir uh - implying that you\\'ve had more governmental executive decision-making uh - experience than uh - your opponent. Now, in his news conference on August twenty-fourth, President Eisenhower was asked to give one example of a major idea of yours that he adopted. His reply was, and I\\'m quoting; \"If you give me a week I might think of one. I don\\'t remember.\" Now that was a month ago, sir, and the President hasn\\'t brought it up since, and I\\'m wondering, sir, if you can clarify which version is correct - the one put out by Republican campaign leaders or the one put out by President Eisenhower?MR. NIXON: Well, I would suggest, Mr. Vanocur, that uh - if you know the President, that was probably a facetious remark. Uh - I would also suggest that insofar as his statement is concerned, that I think it would be improper for the President of the United States to disclose uh - the instances in which members of his official family had made recommendations, as I have made them through the years to him, which he has accepted or rejected. The President has always maintained and very properly so that he is entitled to get what advice he wants from his cabinet and from his other advisers without disclosing that to anybody - including as a matter of fact the Congress. Now, I can only say this. Through the years I have sat in the National Security Council. I have been in the cabinet. I have met with the legislative leaders. I have met with the President when he made the great decisions with regard to Lebanon, Quemoy and Matsu, other matters. The President has asked for my advice. I have given it. Sometimes my advice has been taken. Sometimes it has not. I do not say that I have made the decisions. And I would say that no president should ever allow anybody else to make the major decisions, The president only makes the decisions. All that his advisers do is to give counsel when he asks for it. As far as what experience counts and whether that is experience that counts, that isn\\'t for me to say. Uh - I can only say that my experience is there for the people to consider; Senator Kennedy\\'s is there for the people to consider. As he pointed out, we came to the Congress in the same year. His experience has been different from mine. Mine has been in the executive branch. His has been in the legislative branch. I would say that the people now have the opportunity to evaluate his as against mine and I think both he and I are going to abide by whatever the people decide.MR. SMITH: Senator Kennedy.Mr. KENNEDY: Well, I\\'ll just say that the question is of experience and the question also is uh - what our judgment is of the future, and what our goals are for the United States, and what ability we have to implement those goals. Abraham Lincoln came to the presidency in 1860 after a rather little known uh - session in the House of Representatives and after being defeated for the Senate in fifty-eight and was a distinguished president. There\\'s no certain road to the presidency. There are no guarantees that uh - if you take uh - one road or another that you will be a successful president. I have been in the Congress for fourteen years. I have voted in the last uh - eight years uh - and the Vice President was uh - presiding over the Senate and meeting his other responsibilities. I have met met uh - decisions over eight hundred times on matters which affect not only the domestic security of the United States, but as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The question really is: which candidate and which party can meet the problems that the United States is going to face in the sixties?MR. SMITH: The next question to Senator Kennedy from Mr. Novins.MR. NOVINS: Senator Kennedy, in connection with these problems of the future that you speak of, and the program that you enunciated earlier in your direct talk, you call for expanding some of the welfare programs for schools, for teacher salaries, medical care, and so forth; but you also call for reducing the federal debt. And I\\'m wondering how you, if you\\'re president in January, would go about paying the bill for all this. Does this mean that you?MR. KENNEDY: I didn\\'t indicate. I did not advocate reducing the federal debt because I don\\'t believe that you\\'re going to be able to reduce the federal debt very much in nineteen sixty-one, two, or three. I think you have heavy obligations which affect our security, which we\\'re going to have to meet. And therefore I\\'ve never suggested we should uh - be able to retire the debt substantially, or even at all in nineteen sixty-one or two.MR. NOVINS: Senator, I believe in - in one of your speeches -MR. KENNEDY: No, never.MR. NOVINS: - you suggested that reducing the interest rate would help toward -MR. KENNEDY: No. No. Not reducing the interest -MR. NOVINS: - a reduction of the Federal debt.MR. KENNEDY: - reducing the interest rate. In my judgment, the hard money, tight money policy, fiscal policy of this Administration has contributed to the slow-down in our economy, which helped bring the recession of fifty-four; which made the recession of fifty-eight rather intense, and which has slowed, somewhat, our economic activity in 1960. What I have talked about, however, the kind of programs that I\\'ve talked about, in my judgment, are uh - fiscally sound. Medical care for the aged, I would put under social security. The Vice President and I disagree on this. The program - the Javits-Nixon or the Nixon-Javits program - would have cost, if fully used uh - six hundred million dollars by the government per year, and six hundred million dollars by the state. The program which I advocated, which failed by five votes in the United States Senate, would have put medical care for the aged in Social Security, and would have been paid for through the Social Security System and the Social Security tax. Secondly, I support federal aid to education and federal aid for teachers\\' salaries. I think that\\'s a good investment. I think we\\'re going to have to do it. And I think to heap the burden further on the property tax, which is already strained in many of our communities, will provide, will make sh- insure, in my opinion, that many of our children will not be adequately educated, and many of our teachers not adequately compensated. There is no greater return to an economy or to a society than an educational system second to none. On the question of the development of natural resources, I would pay as you go in the sense that they would be balanced and the power revenues would bring back sufficient money to finance the projects, in the same way as the Tennessee Valley. I believe in the balanced budget. And the only conditions under which I would unbalance the budget would be if there was a grave national emergency or a serious recession. Otherwise, with a steady rate of economic growth - and Mr. Nixon and Mr. Rockefeller, in their meeting, said a five per cent economic growth would bring by 1962 ten billion dollars extra in tax revenues. Whatever is brought in, I think that we can finance essential programs within a balanced budget, if business remains orderly.MR. SMITH: Mr. Nixon, your comment?MR. NIXON: Yes. I think what Mr. Novins was referring to was not one of Senator Kennedy\\'s speeches, but the Democratic platform, which did mention cutting the national debt. I think, too, that it should be pointed out that of course it is not possible, particularly under the proposals that Senator Kennedy has advocated, either to cut the national debt or to reduce taxes. As a matter of fact it will be necessary to raise taxes. As Senator Kennedy points out that as far as his one proposal is concerned - the one for medical care for the aged - that that would be financed out of Social Security. That, however, is raising taxes for those who pay Social Security. He points out that he would make pay-as-you-go be the basis for our natural resources development. Where our natural resources development - which I also support, incidentally, however - whenever you uh - uh - in - in - uh - appropriates money for one of these projects, you have to pay now and appropriate the money and the eh- while they eventually do pay out, it doesn\\'t mean that you - the government doesn\\'t have to put out the money this year. And so I would say that in all of these proposals Senator Kennedy has made, they will result in one of two things: either he has to raise taxes or he has to unbalance the budget. If he unbalances the budget, that means you have inflation, and that will be, of course, a very cruel blow to the very people - the older people - that we\\'ve been talking about. As far as aid for school construction is concerned, I favor that, as Senator Kennedy did, in January of this year, when he said he favored that rather than aid to s- teacher salaries. I favor that because I believe that\\'s the best way to aid our schools without running any risk whatever of the federal government telling our teachers what to teach.MR. SMITH: The next question to Vice President Nixon from Mr. Warren.MR. WARREN: Mr. Vice President you mentioned schools and it was just yesterday I think you asked for a crash program to raise education standards, and this evening you talked about advances in education. Mr. Vice President, you said - it was back in 1957 - that salaries paid to school teachers were nothing short of a national disgrace. Higher salaries for teachers, you added, were important and if the situation wasn\\'t corrected it could lead to a national disaster. And yet, you refused to vote in the Senate in order to break a tie vote when that single vote, if it had been yes, would have granted salary increases to teachers. I wonder if you could explain that, sir.MR. NIXON: I\\'m awfully glad you ge- got that question because as you know I got into it at the last of my other question and wasn\\'t able to complete the argument. Uh - I think that the reason that I voted against having the federal government uh - pay teachers\\' salaries was probably the very reason that concerned Senator Kennedy when in January of this year, in his kick-off press conference, he said that he favored aid for school construction, but at that time did not feel that there should be aid for teachers\\' salaries - at least that\\'s the way I read his remarks. Now, why should there be any question about the federal government aiding s- teachers\\' salaries? Why did Senator Kennedy take that position then? Why do I take it now? We both took it then, and I take it now, for this reason: we want higher teachers\\' salaries. We need higher teachers\\' salaries. But we also want our education to be free of federal control. When the federal government gets the power to pay teachers, inevitably in my opinion, it will acquire the power to set standards and to tell the teachers what to teach. I think this would be bad for the country; I think it would be bad for the teaching profession. There is another point that should be made. I favor higher salaries for teachers. But, as Senator Kennedy said in January of this year in this same press conference, the way that you get higher salaries for teachers is to support school construction, which means that all of the local school districts in the various states then have money which is freed to raise the standards for teachers\\' salaries. I should also point out this; once you put the responsibility on the federal government for paying a portion of teachers\\' salaries, your local communities and your states are not going to meet the responsibility as much as they should. I believe, in other words, that we have seen the local communities and the state assuming more of that responsibility. Teachers\\' salaries very fortunately have gone up fifty percent in the last eight years as against only a thirty-four percent rise for other salaries. This is not enough; it should be more. But I do not believe that the way to get more salaries for teachers is to have the federal government get in with a massive program. My objection here is not the cost in dollars. My objection here is the potential cost in controls and eventual freedom for the American people by giving the federal government power over education, and that is the greatest power a government can have.MR. SMITH: Senator Kennedy\\'s comment?MR. KENNEDY: When uh - the Vice President quotes me in January, sixty, I do not believe the federal government should pay directly teachers\\' salaries, but that was not the issue before the Senate in February. The issue before the Senate was that the money would be given to the state. The state then could determine whether the money would be spent for school construction or teacher salaries. On that question the Vice President and I disagreed. I voted in favor of that proposal and supported it strongly, because I think that that provided assistance to our teachers for their salaries without any chance of federal control and it is on that vote that th- Mr. Nixon and I disagreed, and his tie vote uh - defeated his breaking the tie defeated the proposal. I don\\'t want the federal government paying teachers\\' salaries directly. But if the money will go to the states and the states can then determine whether it shall go for school construction or for teachers\\' salaries, in my opinion you protect the local authority over the school board and the school committee. And therefore I think that was a sound proposal and that is why I supported it and I regret that it did not pass. Secondly, there have been statements made that uh - the Democratic platform would cost a good deal of money and that I am in favor of unbalancing the budget. That is wholly wrong, wholly in error, and it is a fact that in the last eight years the Democratic Congress has reduced the appropri- the requests for the appropriations by over ten billion dollars. That is not my view and I think it ought to be stated very clearly on the record. My view is that you can do these programs - and they should be carefully drawn - within a balanced budget if our economy is moving ahead.MR. SMITH: The next question to Senator Kennedy from Mr. Vanocur.MR. VANOCUR: Senator, you\\'ve been promising the voters that if you are elected president you\\'ll try and push through Congress bills on medical aid to the aged, a comprehensive minimum hourly wage bill, federal aid to education. Now, in the August post-convention session of the Congress, when you at least held up the possibility you could one day be president and when you had overwhelming majorities, especially in the Senate, you could not get action on these bills. Now how do you feel that you\\'ll be able to get them in January -MR. KENNEDY: Well as you take the bills -MR. VANOCUR: - if you weren\\'t able to get them in August?MR. KENNEDY: If I may take the bills, we did pass in the Senate a bill uh - to provide a dollar twenty-five cent minimum wage. It failed because the House did not pass it and the House failed by eleven votes. And I might say that two-thirds of the Republicans in the House voted against a dollar twenty-five cent minimum wage and a majority of the Democrats sustained it - nearly two-thirds of them voted for the dollar twenty-five. We were threatened by a veto if we passed a dollar and a quarter - it\\'s extremely difficult with the great power that the president does to pass any bill when the president is opposed to it. All the president needs to sustain his veto of any bill is one-third plus one in either the House or the Senate. Secondly, we passed a federal aid to education bill in the Senate. It failed to came to the floor of the House of Representatives. It was killed in the Rules Committee. And it is a fact in the August session that the four members of the Rules Committee who were Republicans joining with two Democrats voted against sending the aid to education bill to the floor of the House. Four Democrats voted for it. Every Republican on the Rules Committee voted against sending that bill to be considered by the members of the House of Representatives. Thirdly, on medical care for the aged, this is the same fight that\\'s been going on for twenty-five years in Social Security. We wanted to tie it to Social Security. We offered an amendment to do so. Forty-four Democrats voted for it, one Republican voted for it. And we were informed at the time it came to a vote that if it was adopted the President of the United States would veto it. In my judgment, a vigorous Democratic president supported by a Democratic majority in the House and Senate can win the support for these programs. But if you send a Republican president and a Democratic majority and the threat of a veto hangs over the Congress, in my judgment you will continue what happened in the August session, which is a clash of parties and inaction.MR. SMITH: Mr. Nixon, comment?MR. NIXON: Well obviously my views are a little different. First of all, I don\\'t see how it\\'s possible for a one-third of a body, such as the Republicans have in the House and the Senate to stop two-thirds, if the two-thirds are adequately led. I would say, too, that when Senator Kennedy refers to the action of the House Rules Committee, there are eight Democrats on that committee and four Republicans. It would seem to me again that it is very difficult to blame the four Republicans for the eight Democrats\\' not getting a something through that particular committee. I would say further that to blame the President in his veto power for the inability of the Senator and his colleagues to get action in this special session uh - misses the mark. When the president exercises his veto power, he has to have the people upo- behind him, not just a third of the Congress. Because let\\'s consider it. If the majority of the members of the Congress felt that these particular proposals were good issues - the majority of those who were Democrats - why didn\\'t they pass them and send to the President and get a veto and have an issue? The reason why these particular bills in these various fields that have been mentioned were not passed was not because the President was against them; it was because the people were against them. It was because they were too extreme. And I am convinced that the alternate proposals that I have, that the Republicans have in the field of health, in the field of education, in the field of welfare, because they are not extreme, because they will accomplish the end uh - without too great cost in dollars or in freedom, that they could get through the next Congress.MR. SMITH: The next question to Vice President Nixon fa- from Mr. Fleming.MR. FLEMING: Mr. Vice President, do I take it then you believe that you can work better with Democratic majorities in the House and Senate than Senator Kennedy could work with Democratic majorities in the House and Senate?MR. NIXON; I would say this: that we, of course, expect to pick up some seats in both in the House and the Senate. Uh - We would hope to control the House, to get a majority in the House uh - in this election. We cannot, of course, control the Senate. I would say that a president will be able to lead - a president will be able to get his program through - to the effect that he has the support of the country, the support of the people. Sometimes we - we get the opinion that in getting programs through the House or the Senate it\\'s purely a question of legislative finagling and all that sort of thing. It isn\\'t really that. Whenever a majority of the people are for a program, the House and the Senate responds to it. And whether this House and Senate, in the next session is Democratic or Republican, if the country will have voted for the candidate for the presidency and for the proposals that he has made, I believe that you will find that the president, if it were a Republican, as it would be in my case, would be able to get his program through that Congress. Now, I also say that as far as Senator Kennedy\\'s proposals are concerned, that, again, the question is not simply one of uh - a presidential veto stopping programs. You must always remember that a president can\\'t stop anything unless he has the people behind him. And the reason President Eisenhower\\'s vetoes have been sustained - the reason the Congress does not send up bills to him which they think will be vetoed - is because the people and the Congress, the majority of them, know the country is behind the President.MR. SMITH: Senator Kennedy.MR. KENNEDY: Well, now let\\'s look at these bills that the Vice President suggests were too extreme. One was a bill for a dollar twenty-five cents an hour for anyone who works in a store or company that has a million dollars a year business. I don\\'t think that\\'s extreme at all; and yet nearly two-thirds to three-fourths of the Republicans in the House of Representatives voted against that proposal. Secondly was the federal aid to education bill. It - it was a very uh - because of the defeat of teacher salaries, it was not a bill that uh - met in my opinion the need. The fact of the matter is it was a bill that was less than you recommended, Mr. Nixon, this morning in your proposal. It was not an extreme bill and yet we could not get one Republican to join, at least I think four of the eight Democrats voted to send it to the floor of the House - not one Republican - and they joined with those Democrats who were opposed to it. I don\\'t say the Democrats are united in their support of the program. But I do say a majority are. And I say a majority of the Republicans are opposed to it. The third is medical care for the aged which is tied to Social Security, which is financed out of Social Security funds. It does not put a deficit on the Treasury. The proposal advanced by you and by Mr. Javits would have cost six hundred millions of dollars - Mr. Rockefeller rejected it in New York, said he didn\\'t agree with the financing at all, said it ought to be on Social Security. So these are three programs which are quite moderate. I think it shows the difference between the two parties. One party is ready to move in these programs. The other party gives them lip service.MR. SMITH: Mr. Warren\\'s question for Senator Kennedy.MR. WARREN: Senator Kennedy, on another subject, Communism is so often described as an ideology or a belief that exists somewhere other than in the United States. Let me ask you, sir: just how serious a threat to our national security are these Communist subversive activities in the United States today?MR. KENNEDY: Well, I think they\\'re serious. I think it\\'s a matter that we should continue to uh - give uh - great care and attention to. We should support uh - the laws which the United States has passed in order to protect us from uh - those who would destroy us from within. We should sustain uh - the Department of Justice in its efforts and the F.B.I., and we should be continually alert. I think if the United States is maintaining a strong society here in the United States, I think that we can meet any internal threat. The major threat is external and will continue.MR. SMITH: Mr. Nixon, comment?MR. NIXON: I agree with Senator Kennedy\\'s appraisal generally in this respect. The question of Communism within the United States has been one that has worried us in the past. It is one that will continue to be a problem for years to come. We have to remember that the cold war that Mr. Khrushchev is waging and his colleagues are waging, is waged all over the world and it\\'s waged right here in the United States. That\\'s why we have to continue to be alert. It is also essential in being alert that we be fair; fair because by being fair we uphold the very freedoms that the Communists would destroy. We uphold the standards of conduct which they would never follow. And, in this connection, I think that uh - we must look to the future having in mind the fact that we fight Communism at home not only by our laws to deal with Communists uh - the few who do become Communists and the few who do become tra- fellow travelers, but we also fight Communism at home by moving against those various injustices which exist in our society which the Communists feed upon. And in that connection I again would say that while Senator Kennedy says we are for the status quo, I do believe that he uh - would agree that I am just as sincere in believing that my proposals for federal aid to education, my proposals for health care are just as sincerely held as his. The question again is not one of goals - we\\'re for those goals - it\\'s one of means.MR. SMITH: Mr. Vanocur\\'s question for Vice President Nixon.MR. VANOCUR: Mr. Vice President uh - in one of your earlier statements you said we\\'ve moved ahead, we\\'ve built more schools, we\\'ve built more hospitals. Now, sir, isn\\'t it true that the building of more schools is a local matter for financing? Uh - Were you claiming that the Eisenhower Administration was responsible for the building of these schools, or is it the local school districts that provide for it?MR. NIXON: Not at all. As a matter of fact your question brings out a point that I am very glad to make. Too often in appraising whether we are moving ahead or not we think only of what the federal government is doing. Now that isn\\'t the test of whether America moves. The test of whether America moves is whether the federal government, plus the state government, plus the local government, plus the biggest segment of all - individual enterprise - moves. We have for example a gross national product of approximately five hundred billion dollars. Roughly a hundred billion to a hundred and a quarter billion of that is the result of government activity. Four hundred billion, approximately, is a result of what individuals do. Now, the reason the Eisenhower Administration has moved, the reason that we\\'ve had the funds, for example, locally to build the schools, and the hospitals, and the highways, to make the progress that we have, is because this Administration has encouraged individual enterprise; and it has resulted in the greatest expansion of the private sector of the economy that has ever been witnessed in an eight-year period. And that is growth. That is the growth that we are looking for; it is the growth that this Administration has supported and that its policies have stimulated.MR. SMITH: Senator Kennedy.MR. KENNEDY: Well, I must say that the reason that the schools have been constructed is because the local school districts were willing to increase the property taxes to a tremendously high figure - in my opinion, almost to the point of diminishing returns in order to sustain these schools. Secondly, I think we have a rich uh - country. And I think we have a powerful country. I think what we have to do, however, is have the president and the leadership set before our country exactly what we must do in the next decade, if we\\'re going to maintain our security in education, in economic growth, in development of natural resources. The Soviet Union is making great gains. It isn\\'t enough to compare what might have been done eight years ago, or ten years ago, or fifteen years ago, or twenty years ago. I want to compare what we\\'re doing with what our adversaries are doing, so that by the year 1970 the United States is ahead in education, in health, in building, in homes, in economic strength. I think that\\'s the big assignment, the big task, the big function of the federal government.MR. SMITH: Can I have the summation time please? We\\'ve completed our questions and our comments, and in just a moment, we\\'ll have the summation time.VOICE: This will allow three minutes and twenty seconds for the summation by each candidate.MR. SM1TH: Three minutes and twenty seconds for each candidate. Vice President Nixon, will you make the first summation?MR. NIXON: Thank you, Mr. Smith. Senator Kennedy. First of all, I think it is well to put in perspective where we really do stand with regard to the Soviet Union in this whole matter of growth. The Soviet Union has been moving faster than we have. But the reason for that is obvious. They start from a much lower base. Although they have been moving faster in growth than we have, we find, for example, today that their total gross national product is only forty-four per cent of our total gross national product. That\\'s the same percentage that it was twenty years ago. And as far as the absolute gap is concerned, we find that the United States is even further ahead than it was twenty years ago. Is this any reason for complacency? Not at all Because these are determined men. They are fanatical men. And we have to get the very most of uh - out uh - out of our economy. I agree with Senator Kennedy completely on that score. Where we disagree is in the means that we would use to get the most out of our economy. I respectfully submit that Senator Kennedy too often would rely too much on the federal government, on what it would do to solve our problems, to stimulate growth. I believe that when we examine the Democratic platform, when we examine the proposals that he has discussed tonight, when we compare them with the proposals that I have made, that these proposals that he makes would not result in greater growth for this country than would be the case if we followed the programs that I have advocated. There are many of the points that he has made that I would like to comment upon. The one in the field of health is worth mentioning. Our health program - the one that Senator Javits and other Republican Senators, as well as I supported - is one that provides for all people over sixty-five who want health insurance, the opportunity to have it if they want it. It provides a choice of having either government insurance or private insurance. But it compels nobody to have insurance who does not want it. His program under Social Security, would require everybody who had Social Security to take government health insurance whether he wanted it or not. And it would not cover several million people who are not covered by Social Security at all. Here is one place where I think that our program does a better job than his. The other point that I would make is this: this downgrading of how much things cost I think many of our people will understand better when they look at what happened when - during the Truman Administration when the government was spending more than it took in - we found savings over a lifetime eaten up by inflation. We found the people who could least afford it - people on retired incomes uh - people on fixed incomes - we found them unable to meet their bills at the end of the month. It is essential that a man who\\'s president of this country certainly stand for every program that will mean for growth. And I stand for programs that will mean growth and progress. But it is also essential that he not allow a dollar spent that could be better spent by the people themselves.MR. SMITH: Senator Kennedy, your conclusion.MR. KENNEDY: The point was made by Mr. Nixon that the Soviet production is only forty-four percent of ours. I must say that forty-four percent and that Soviet country is causing us a good deal of trouble tonight. I want to make sure that it stays in that relationship. I don\\'t want to see the day when it\\'s sixty percent of ours, and seventy and seventy-five and eighty and ninety percent of ours, with all the force and power that it could bring to bear in order to cause our destruction. Secondly, the Vice President mentioned medical care for the aged. Our program was an amendment to the Kerr bill. The Kerr bill provided assistance to all those who were not on Social Security. I think it\\'s a very clear contrast. In 1935, when the Social Security Act was written, ninety-four out of ninety-five Republicans voted against it. Mr. Landon ran in 1936 to repeal it. In August of 1960, when we tried to get it again, but this time for medical care, we received the support of one Republican in the Senate on this occasion. Thirdly, I think the question before the American people is: as they look at this country and as they look at the world around them, the goals are the same for all Americans. The means are at question. The means are at issue. If you feel that everything that is being done now is satisfactory, that the relative power and prestige and strength of the United States is increasing in relation to that of the Communists; that we\\'ve b- gaining more security, that we are achieving everything as a nation that we should achieve, that we are achieving a better life for our citizens and greater strength, then I agree. I think you should vote for Mr. Nixon. But if you feel that we have to move again in the sixties, that the function of the president is to set before the people the unfinished business of our society as Franklin Roosevelt did in the thirties, the agenda for our people - what we must do as a society to meet our needs in this country and protect our security and help the cause of freedom. As I said at the beginning, the question before us all, that faces all Republicans and all Democrats, is: can freedom in the next generation conquer, or are the Communists going to be successful? That\\'s the great issue. And if we meet our responsibilities I think freedom will conquer. If we fail, if we fail to move ahead, if we fail to develop sufficient military and economic and social strength here in this country, then I think that uh - the tide could begin to run against us. And I don\\'t want historians, ten years from now, to say, these were the years when the tide ran out for the United States. I want them to say these were the years when the tide came in; these were the years when the United States started to move again. That\\'s the question before the American people, and only you can decide what you want, what you want this country to be, what you want to do with the future. I think we\\'re ready to move. And it is to that great task, if we\\'re successful, that we will address ourselves.MR. SMITH: Thank you very much, gentlemen. This hour has gone by all too quickly. Thank you very much for permitting us to present the next president of the United States on this unique program. I\\'ve been asked by the candidates to thank the American networks and the affiliated stations for providing time and facilities for this joint appearance. Other debates in this series will be announced later and will be on different subjects. This is Howard K. Smith. Good night from Chicago.']"

       "['October 3  2012 Debate TranscriptPRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA AND FORMER GOV  MITT ROMNEY  R MASS   PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE  PARTICIPATE IN A CANDIDATES DEBATE  UNIVERSITY OF DENVER  COLORADOOCTOBER 3  2012SPEAKERS: FORMER GOV  MITT ROMNEY  R MASS PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMAJIM LEHRER  MODERATORLEHRER: Good evening from the Magness Arena at the University of Denver in Denver  Colorado  I\\'m Jim Lehrer of the \"PBS NewsHour \" and I welcome you to the first of the 2012 presidential debates between President Barack Obama  the Democratic nominee  and former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney  the Republican nominee LEHRER: This debate and the next three    two presidential  one vice presidential    are sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates  Tonight\\'s 90 minutes will be about domestic issues and will follow a format designed by the commission  There will be six roughly 15 minute segments with two minute answers for the first question  then open discussion for the remainder of each segment Thousands of people offered suggestions on segment subjects or questions via the Internet and other means  but I made the final selections  And for the record  they were not submitted for approval to the commission or the candidates The segments as I announced in advance will be three on the economy and one each on health care  the role of government and governing  with an emphasis throughout on differences  specifics and choices  Both candidates will also have two minute closing statements The audience here in the hall has promised to remain silent    no cheers  applause  boos  hisses  among other noisy distracting things  so we may all concentrate on what the candidates have to say  There is a noise exception right now  though  as we welcome President Obama and Governor Romney (APPLAUSE)Gentlemen  welcome to you both  Let\\'s start the economy  segment one  and let\\'s begin with jobs  w hat are the major differences between the two of you about how you would go about creating new jobs LEHRER: You have two minutes  Each of you have two minutes to start  A coin toss has determined  Mr  President  you go first OBAMA: w ell  thank you very much  Jim  for this opportunity  I want to thank Governor Romney and the University of Denver for your hospitality There are a lot of points I want to make tonight  but the most important one is that 20 years ago I became the luckiest man on Earth because Michelle Obama agreed to marry me And so I just want to wish  Sweetie  you happy anniversary and let you know that a year from now we will not be celebrating it in front of 40 million people (LAUGHTER)You know  four years ago we went through the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression  Millions of jobs were lost  the auto industry was on the brink of collapse  The financial system had frozen up And because of the resilience and the determination of the American people  we\\'ve begun to fight our way back  Over the last 30 months  we\\'ve seen 5 million jobs in the private sector created  The auto industry has come roaring back  And housing has begun to rise But we all know that we\\'ve still got a lot of work to do  And so the question here tonight is not where we\\'ve been  but where we\\'re going Governor Romney has a perspective that says if we cut taxes  skewed towards the wealthy  and roll back regulations  that we\\'ll be better off  I\\'ve got a different view I think we\\'ve got to invest in education and training  I think it\\'s important for us to develop new sources of energy here in America  that we change our tax code to make sure that we\\'re helping small businesses and companies that are investing here in the United States  that we take some of the money that we\\'re saving as we wind down two wars to rebuild America and that we reduce our deficit in a balanced way that allows us to make these critical investments Now  it ultimately is going to be up to the voters    to you    which path we should take  Are we going to double on top down economic policies that helped to get us into this mess or do we embrace a new economic patriotism that says America does best when the middle class does best  And I\\'m looking forward to having that debate LEHRER: Governor Romney  two minutes ROMNEY: Thank you  Jim  It\\'s an honor to be here with you  and I appreciate the chance to be with the president  I\\'m pleased to be at the University of Denver  appreciate their welcome  and also the Presidential Commission on these debates And congratulations to you  Mr  President  on your anniversary  I\\'m sure this was the most romantic place you could imagine  here    here with me  So I   (LAUGHTER)Congratulations This is obviously a very tender topic  I\\'ve had the occasion over the last couple of years of meeting people across the country  I was in Dayton  Ohio  and a woman grabbed my arm and she said  \"I\\'ve been out of work since May  Can you help me \"Ann yesterday was at a rally in Denver and a woman came up to her with a baby in her arms and said  \"Ann  my husband has had four jobs in three years  part time jobs  He\\'s lost his most recent job and we\\'ve now just lost our home  Can you help us \"And the answer is  yes  we can help  but it\\'s going to take a different path  Not the one we\\'ve been on  not the one the president describes as a top down  cut taxes for the rich  That\\'s not what I\\'m going to do My plan has five basic parts  One  get us energy independent  North American energy independent  That creates about 4 million jobs Number two  open up more trade  particularly in Latin America  Crack down on China  if and when they cheat Number three  make sure our people have the skills they need to succeed and the best schools in the world  w e\\'re far away from that now Number four  get to us a balanced budget Number five  champion small business  It\\'s small business that creates the jobs in America  and over the last four years  small business people have decided that America may not be the place to open a new business because new business startups are down to a 30 year low ROMNEY: Now  I\\'m concerned that the path that we\\'re on has just been unsuccessful  The president has a view very similar to the view he had when he ran four years  that a bigger government  spending more  taxing more  regulating more    if you will  trickle down government    would work That\\'s not the right answer for America  I\\'ll restore the vitality that gets America working again  Thank you LEHRER: Mr  President  please respond directly to what the governor just said about trickle down    his trick down approach  as he said yours is OBAMA: w ell  let me talk specifically about what I think we need to do  First  we\\'ve got to improve our education system and we\\'ve made enormous progress drawing on ideas both from Democrats and Republicans that are already starting to show gains in some of the toughest to deal with schools  w e\\'ve got a program called Race to the Top that has prompted reforms in 46 states around the country  raising standards  improving how we train teachers So now I want to hire another 100 000 new math and science teachers  and create 2 million more slots in our community colleges so that people can get trained for the jobs that are out there right now  And I want to make sure that we keep tuition low for our young people w hen it comes to our tax code  Governor Romney and I both agree that our corporate tax rate is too high  so I want to lower it  particularly for manufacturing  taking it down to 25 percent  But I also want to close those loopholes that are giving incentives for companies that are shipping jobs overseas  I want to provide tax breaks for companies that are investing here in the United States On energy  Governor Romney and I  we both agree that we\\'ve got to boost American energy production  and oil and natural gas production are higher than they\\'ve been in years  But I also believe that we\\'ve got to look at the energy sources of the future  like wind and solar and biofuels  and make those investments OBAMA: So all of this is possible  Now  in order for us to do it  we do have to close our deficit  and one of the things I\\'m sure we\\'ll be discussing tonight is  how do we deal with our tax code  And how do we make sure that we are reducing spending in a responsible way  but also  how do we have enough revenue to make those investments And this is where there\\'s a difference  because Governor Romney\\'s central economic plan calls for a $5 trillion tax cut    on top of the extension of the Bush tax cuts    that\\'s another trillion dollars    and $2 trillion in additional military spending that the military hasn\\'t asked for  That\\'s $8 trillion  How we pay for that  reduce the deficit  and make the investments that we need to make  without dumping those costs onto middle class Americans  I think is one of the central questions of this campaign LEHRER: Both of you have spoken about a lot of different things  and we\\'re going to try to get through them in as specific a way as we possibly can But  first  Governor Romney  do you have a question that you\\'d like to ask the president directly about something he just said ROMNEY: w ell  sure  I\\'d like to clear up the record and go through it piece by piece First of all  I don\\'t have a $5 trillion tax cut  I don\\'t have a tax cut of a scale that you\\'re talking about  My view is that we ought to provide tax relief to people in the middle class  But I\\'m not going to reduce the share of taxes paid by high income people  High income people are doing just fine in this economy  They\\'ll do fine whether you\\'re president or I am The people who are having the hard time right now are middle  income Americans  Under the president\\'s policies  middle income Americans have been buried  They\\'re just being crushed  Middle  income Americans have seen their income come down by $4 300  This is a    this is a tax in and of itself  I\\'ll call it the economy tax  It\\'s been crushing At the same time  gasoline prices have doubled under the president  Electric rates are up  Food prices are up  Health care costs have gone up by $2 500 a family  Middle income families are being crushed ROMNEY: And so the question is how to get them going again  And I\\'ve described it  It\\'s energy and trade  the right kind of training programs  balancing our budget and helping small business  Those are the    the cornerstones of my plan But the president mentioned a couple of other ideas I\\'ll just note  First  education  I agree: Education is key  particularly the future of our economy  But our training programs right now  we\\'ve got 47 of them  housed in the federal government  reporting to eight different agencies  Overhead is overwhelming  w e\\'ve got to get those dollars back to the states and go to the workers so they can create their own pathways to get in the training they need for jobs that will really help them The second area  taxation  we agree  we ought to bring the tax rates down  And I do  both for corporations and for individuals  But in order for us not to lose revenue  have the government run out of money  I also lower deductions and credits and exemptions  so that we keep taking in the same money when you also account for growth The third area  energy  Energy is critical  and the president pointed out correctly that production of oil and gas in the U S  is up  But not due to his policies  In spite of his policies Mr  President  all of the increase in natural gas and oil has happened on private land  not on government land  On government land  your administration has cut the number of permits and licenses in half  If I\\'m president  I\\'ll double them  and also get the    the oil from offshore and Alaska  And I\\'ll bring that pipeline in from Canada And  by the way  I like coal  I\\'m going to make sure we can continue to burn clean coal  People in the coal industry feel like it\\'s getting crushed by your policies  I want to get America and North America energy independent so we can create those jobs And finally  with regards to that tax cut  look  I\\'m not looking to cut massive taxes and to reduce the    the revenues going to the government  My    my number one principal is  there will be no tax cut that adds to the deficit  I want to underline that: no tax cut that adds to the deficit But I do want to reduce the burden being paid by middle income Americans  And I    and to do that  that also means I cannot reduce the burden paid by high income Americans  So any    any language to the contrary is simply not accurate  LEHRER: Mr  President OBAMA: w ell  I think    let\\'s talk about taxes  because I think it\\'s instructive  Now  four years ago  when I stood on this stage  I said that I would cut taxes for middle class families  And that\\'s exactly what I did  w e cut taxes for middle class families by about $3 600 And the reason is  because I believe that we do best when the middle class is doing well  And by giving them those tax cuts  they had a little more money in their pocket  and so maybe they can buy a new car  They are certainly in a better position to weather the extraordinary recession that we went through  They can buy a computer for their kid who\\'s going off to college  which means they\\'re spending more money  businesses have more customers  businesses make more profits  and then hire more workers Now  Governor Romney\\'s proposal that he has been promoting for 18 months calls for a $5 trillion tax cut  on top of $2 trillion of additional spending for our military  And he is saying that he is going to pay for it by closing loopholes and deductions  The problem is that he\\'s been asked over 100 times how you would close those deductions and loopholes  and he hasn\\'t been able to identify them But I\\'m going to make an important point here  Jim LEHRER: All right OBAMA: w hen you add up all the loopholes and deductions that upper income individuals can    are currently taking advantage of  you take those all away  you don\\'t come close to paying for $5 trillion in tax cuts and $2 trillion in additional military spending OBAMA: And that\\'s why independent studies looking at this said the only way to meet Governor Romney\\'s pledge of not reducing the deficit or    or    or not adding to the deficit is by burdening middle class families  The average middle class family with children would pay about $2 000 more Now  that\\'s not my analysis  That\\'s the analysis of economists who have looked at this  And    and that kind of top    top down economics  where folks at the top are doing well  so the average person making $3 million is getting a $250 000 tax break  while middle class families are burdened further  that\\'s not what I believe is a recipe for economic growth LEHRER: All right  w hat is the difference  Let\\'s just stay on taxes (CROSSTALK)LEHRER: Just    let\\'s just stay on taxes for (inaudible) (CROSSTALK)LEHRER: w hat is the difference   ROMNEY: w ell  but    but virtually    virtually everything he just said about my tax plan is inaccurate LEHRER: All right ROMNEY: So if the tax plan he described were a tax plan I was asked to support  I\\'d say absolutely not  I\\'m not looking for a $5 trillion tax cut  w hat I\\'ve said is I won\\'t put in place a tax cut that adds to the deficit  That\\'s part one  So there\\'s no economist that can say Mitt Romney\\'s tax plan adds $5 trillion if I say I will not add to the deficit with my tax plan Number two  I will not reduce the share paid by high income individuals  I know that you and your running mate keep saying that and I know it\\'s a popular thing to say with a lot of people  but it\\'s just not the case  Look  I\\'ve got five boys  I\\'m used to people saying something that\\'s not always true  but just keep on repeating it and ultimately hoping I\\'ll believe it  But that    that is not the case  All right  I will not reduce the taxes paid by high income Americans And number three  I will not under any circumstances raise taxes on middle income families  I will lower taxes on middle income families  Now  you cite a study  There are six other studies that looked at the study you describe and say it\\'s completely wrong  I saw a study that came out today that said you\\'re going to raise taxes by $3 000 to $4 000 on middle income families There are all these studies out there  But let\\'s get at the bottom line  That is  I want to bring down rates  I want to bring the rates down  at the same time lower deductions and exemptions and credits and so forth  so we keep getting the revenue we need  And you\\'d think  well  then why lower the rates ROMNEY: And the reason is because small business pays that individual rate; 54 percent of America\\'s workers work in businesses that are taxed not at the corporate tax rate  but at the individual tax rate  And if we lower that rate  they will be able to hire more people  For me  this is about jobs  This is about getting jobs for the American people (CROSSTALK)LEHRER: That\\'s where we started  Yeah Do you challenge what the governor just said about his own plan OBAMA: w ell  for 18 months he\\'s been running on this tax plan  And now  five weeks before the election  he\\'s saying that his big  bold idea is  \"Never mind \"And the fact is that if you are lowering the rates the way you described  Governor  then it is not possible to come up with enough deductions and loopholes that only affect high income individuals to avoid either raising the deficit or burdening the middle class  It\\'s    it\\'s math  It\\'s arithmetic Now  Governor Romney and I do share a deep interest in encouraging small business growth  So at the same time that my tax plan has already lowered taxes for 98 percent of families  I also lowered taxes for small businesses 18 times  And what I want to do is continue the tax rates    the tax cuts that we put into place for small businesses and families But I have said that for incomes over $250 000 a year  that we should go back to the rates that we had when Bill Clinton was president  when we created 23 million new jobs  went from deficit to surplus  and created a whole lot of millionaires to boot And the reason this is important is because by doing that  we cannot only reduce the deficit  we cannot only encourage job growth through small businesses  but we\\'re also able to make the investments that are necessary in education or in energy OBAMA: And we do have a difference  though  when it comes to definitions of small business  Under    under my plan  97 percent of small businesses would not see their income taxes go up  Governor Romney says  well  those top 3 percent  they\\'re the job creators  they\\'d be burdened But under Governor Romney\\'s definition  there are a whole bunch of millionaires and billionaires who are small businesses  Donald Trump is a small business  Now  I know Donald Trump doesn\\'t like to think of himself as small anything  but    but that\\'s how you define small businesses if you\\'re getting business income And that kind of approach  I believe  will not grow our economy  because the only way to pay for it without either burdening the middle class or blowing up our deficit is to make drastic cuts in things like education  making sure that we are continuing to invest in basic science and research  all the things that are helping America grow  And I think that would be a mistake LEHRER: All right ROMNEY: Jim  let me just come back on that    on that point  which is these   LEHRER: Just for the    just for record   (CROSSTALK)ROMNEY:     the small businesses we\\'re talking about   LEHRER: Excuse me  Excuse me  Just so everybody understands  we\\'re way over our first 15 minutes ROMNEY: It\\'s fun  isn\\'t it LEHRER: It\\'s OK  it\\'s great  No problem  w ell  you all don\\'t have    you don\\'t have a problem  I don\\'t have a problem  because we\\'re still on the economy  w e\\'re going to come back to taxes  I want move on to the deficit and a lot of other things  too OK  but go ahead  sir ROMNEY: You bet  w ell  President  you\\'re    Mr  President  you\\'re absolutely right  which is that  with regards to 97 percent of the businesses are not    not taxed at the 35 percent tax rate  they\\'re taxed at a lower rate  But those businesses that are in the last 3 percent of businesses happen to employ half    half of all the people who work in small business  Those are the businesses that employ one quarter of all the workers in America  And your plan is to take their tax rate from 35 percent to 40 percent Now  and    and I\\'ve talked to a guy who has a very small business  He\\'s in the electronics business in    in St  Louis  He has four employees  He said he and his son calculated how much they pay in taxes  federal income tax  federal payroll tax  state income tax  state sales tax  state property tax  gasoline tax  It added up to well over 50 percent of what they earned  And your plan is to take the tax rate on successful small businesses from 35 percent to 40 percent  The National Federation of Independent Businesses has said that will cost 700 000 jobs I don\\'t want to cost jobs  My priority is jobs  And so what I do is I bring down the tax rates  lower deductions and exemptions  the same idea behind Bowles Simpson  by the way  get the rates down  lower deductions and exemptions  to create more jobs  because there\\'s nothing better for getting us to a balanced budget than having more people working  earning more money  paying more taxes  That\\'s by far the most effective and efficient way to get this budget balanced OBAMA: Jim  I    you may want to move onto another topic  but I    I would just say this to the American people  If you believe that we can cut taxes by $5 trillion and add $2 trillion in additional spending that the military is not asking for  $7 trillion    just to give you a sense  over 10 years  that\\'s more than our entire defense budget    and you think that by closing loopholes and deductions for the well to do  somehow you will not end up picking up the tab  then Governor Romney\\'s plan may work for you But I think math  common sense  and our history shows us that\\'s not a recipe for job growth  Look  we\\'ve tried this  w e\\'ve tried both approaches  The approach that Governor Romney\\'s talking about is the same sales pitch that was made in 2001 and 2003  and we ended up with the slowest job growth in 50 years  we ended up moving from surplus to deficits  and it all culminated in the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression OBAMA: Bill Clinton tried the approach that I\\'m talking about  w e created 23 million new jobs  w e went from deficit to surplus  And businesses did very well  So  in some ways  we\\'ve got some data on which approach is more likely to create jobs and opportunity for Americans and I believe that the economy works best when middle class families are getting tax breaks so that they\\'ve got some money in their pockets  and those of us who have done extraordinarily well because of this magnificent country that we live in  that we can afford to do a little bit more to make sure we\\'re not blowing up the deficit ROMNEY: Jim  the president began this segment  so I think I get the last word (CROSSTALK)LEHRER: w ell  you\\'re going to get the first word in the next segment ROMNEY: All right  w ell  but he gets the first word of that segment  I get the last word (inaudible) I hope  Let me just make this comment (CROSSTALK)ROMNEY: I think first of all  let me    let me repeat    let me repeat what I said  I\\'m not in favor of a $5 trillion tax cut  That\\'s not my plan  My plan is not to put in place any tax cut that will add to the deficit  That\\'s point one So you may keep referring to it as a $5 trillion tax cut  but that\\'s not my plan Number two  let\\'s look at history  My plan is not like anything that\\'s been tried before  My plan is to bring down rates  but also bring down deductions and exemptions and credits at the same time so the revenue stays in  but that we bring down rates to get more people working My priority is putting people back to work in America  They\\'re suffering in this country  And we talk about evidence  Look at the evidence of the last four years  It\\'s absolutely extraordinary  w e\\'ve got 23 million people out of work or stopped looking for work in this country  It\\'s just    it\\'s    we\\'ve got    when the president took office  32 million people on food stamps; 47 million on food stamps today; economic growth this year slower than last year  and last year slower than the year before Going forward with the status quo is not going to cut it for the American people who are struggling today LEHRER: All right  Let\\'s talk    we\\'re still on the economy  This is  theoretically now  a second segment still on the economy  and specifically on what to do about the federal deficit  the federal debt And the question  you each have two minutes on this  and Governor Romney  you    you go first because the president went first on segment one  And the question is this  what are the differences between the two of you as to how you would go about tackling the deficit problem in this country ROMNEY: Good  I\\'m glad you raised that  and it\\'s a    it\\'s a critical issue  I think it\\'s not just an economic issue  I think it\\'s a moral issue  I think it\\'s  frankly  not moral for my generation to keep spending massively more than we take in  knowing those burdens are going to be passed on to the next generation and they\\'re going to be paying the interest and the principal all their lives And the amount of debt we\\'re adding  at a trillion a year  is simply not moral So how do we deal with it  w ell  mathematically  there are three ways that you can cut a deficit  One  of course  is to raise taxes  Number two is to cut spending  And number is to grow the economy  because if more people work in a growing economy  they\\'re paying taxes  and you can get the job done that way The presidents would    president would prefer raising taxes  I understand  The problem with raising taxes is that it slows down the rate of growth  And you could never quite get the job done  I want to lower spending and encourage economic growth at the same time w hat things would I cut from spending  w ell  first of all  I will eliminate all programs by this test  if they don\\'t pass it: Is the program so critical it\\'s worth borrowing money from China to pay for it  And if not  I\\'ll get rid of it  Obamacare\\'s on my list I apologize  Mr  President  I use that term with all respect  by the way OBAMA: I like it ROMNEY: Good  OK  good  So I\\'ll get rid of that I\\'m sorry  Jim  I\\'m going to stop the subsidy to PBS  I\\'m going to stop other things  I like PBS  I love Big Bird  Actually like you  too  But I\\'m not going to    I\\'m not going to keep on spending money on things to borrow money from China to pay for  That\\'s number one Number two  I\\'ll take programs that are currently good programs but I think could be run more efficiently at the state level and send them to the state ROMNEY: Number three  I\\'ll make government more efficient and to cut back the number of employees  combine some agencies and departments  My cutbacks will be done through attrition  by the way This is the approach we have to take to get America to a balanced budget The president said he\\'d cut the deficit in half  Unfortunately  he doubled it  Trillion dollar deficits for the last four years  The president\\'s put it in place as much public debt    almost as much debt held by the public as al prior presidents combined LEHRER: Mr  President  two minutes OBAMA: w hen I walked into the Oval Office  I had more than a trillion dollar deficit greeting me  And we know where it came from: two wars that were paid for on a credit card; two tax cuts that were not paid for; and a whole bunch of programs that were not paid for; and then a massive economic crisis And despite that  what we\\'ve said is  yes  we had to take some initial emergency measures to make sure we didn\\'t slip into a Great Depression  but what we\\'ve also said is  let\\'s make sure that we are cutting out those things that are not helping us grow So 77 government programs  everything from aircrafts that the Air Force had ordered but weren\\'t working very well  18 government    18 government programs for education that were well intentioned  not weren\\'t helping kids learn  we went after medical fraud in Medicare and Medicaid very aggressively  more aggressively than ever before  and have saved tens of billions of dollars  $50 billion of waste taken out of the system And I worked with Democrats and Republicans to cut a trillion dollars out of our discretionary domestic budget  That\\'s the largest cut in the discretionary domestic budget since Dwight Eisenhower Now  we all know that we\\'ve got to do more  And so I\\'ve put forward a specific $4 trillion deficit reduction plan  It\\'s on a website  You can look at all the numbers  what cuts we make and what revenue we raise And the way we do it is $2 50 for every cut  we ask for $1 of additional revenue  paid for  as I indicated earlier  by asking those of us who have done very well in this country to contribute a little bit more to reduce the deficit  Governor Romney earlier mentioned the Bowles Simpson commission  w ell  that\\'s how the commission    bipartisan commission that talked about how we should move forward suggested we have to do it  in a balanced way with some revenue and some spending cuts  And this is a major difference that Governor Romney and I have Let    let me just finish their point  because you\\'re looking for contrast  You know  when Governor Romney stood on a stage with other Republican candidates for the nomination and he was asked  would you take $10 of spending cuts for just $1 of revenue  And he said no Now  if you take such an unbalanced approach  then that means you are going to be gutting our investments in schools and education  It means that Governor Romney   (CROSSTALK)OBAMA:     talked about Medicaid and how we could send it back to the states  but effectively this means a 30 percent cut in the primary program we help for seniors who are in nursing homes  for kids who are with disabilities LEHRER: Mr  President  I\\'m sorry OBAMA: And    and that is not a right strategy for us to move forward LEHRER: w ay over the two minutes OBAMA: Sorry LEHRER: Governor  what about Simpson Bowles  Do you support Simpson Bowles ROMNEY: Simpson Bowles  the president should have grabbed that LEHRER: No  I mean  do you support Simpson Bowles ROMNEY: I have my own plan  It\\'s not the same as Simpson  Bowles  But in my view  the president should have grabbed it  If you wanted to make some adjustments to it  take it  go to Congress  fight for it OBAMA: That\\'s what we\\'ve done  made some adjustments to it  and we\\'re putting it forward before Congress right now  a $4 trillion plan   ROMNEY: But you\\'ve been    but you\\'ve been president four years   (CROSSTALK)ROMNEY: You\\'ve been president four years  You said you\\'d cut the deficit in half  It\\'s now four years later  w e still have trillion dollar deficits  The CBO says we\\'ll have a trillion dollar deficit each of the next four years  If you\\'re re elected  we\\'ll get to a trillion dollar debt ROMNEY: I mean  you have said before you\\'d cut the deficit in half  And this    I love this idea of $4 trillion in cuts  You found $4 trillion of ways to reduce or to get closer to a balanced budget  except we still show trillion dollar deficits every year  That doesn\\'t get the job done Let me come back and say  why is it that I don\\'t want to raise taxes  w hy don\\'t I want to raise taxes on people  And actually  you said it back in 2010  You said  \"Look  I\\'m going to extend the tax policies that we have now; I\\'m not going to raise taxes on anyone  because when the economy is growing slow like this  when we\\'re in recession  you shouldn\\'t raise taxes on anyone \"w ell  the economy is still growing slow  As a matter of fact  it\\'s growing much more slowly now than when you made that statement  And so if you believe the same thing  you just don\\'t want to raise taxes on people  And the reality is it\\'s not just wealthy people    you mentioned Donald Trump  It\\'s not just Donald Trump you\\'re taxing  It\\'s all those businesses that employ one quarter of the workers in America; these small businesses that are taxed as individuals You raise taxes and you kill jobs  That\\'s why the National Federation of Independent Businesses said your plan will kill 700 000 jobs  I don\\'t want to kill jobs in this environment I\\'ll make one more point (CROSSTALK)LEHRER: (inaudible) answer the taxes thing for a moment ROMNEY: OK LEHRER: Mr  President OBAMA: w ell  we\\'ve had this discussion before LEHRER: About the idea that in order to reduce the deficit  there has to be revenue in addition to cuts OBAMA: There has to be revenue in addition to cuts  Now  Governor Romney has ruled out revenue  He\\'s ruled out revenue (CROSSTALK)ROMNEY: Absolutely  (CROSSTALK)ROMNEY: Look  the revenue I get is by more people working  getting higher pay  paying more taxes  That\\'s how we get growth and how we balance the budget  But the idea of taxing people more  putting more people out of work  you\\'ll never get there  You\\'ll never balance the budget by raising taxes Spain    Spain spends 42 percent of their total economy on government  w e\\'re now spending 42 percent of our economy on government  I don\\'t want to go down the path to Spain  I want to go down the path of growth that puts Americans to work with more money coming in because they\\'re working LEHRER: But    but Mr  President  you\\'re saying in order to    to get the job done  it\\'s got to be balanced  You\\'ve got to have   (CROSSTALK)OBAMA: If    if we\\'re serious  we\\'ve got to take a balanced  responsible approach  And by the way  this is not just when it comes to individual taxes  Let\\'s talk about corporate taxes Now  I\\'ve identified areas where we can  right away  make a change that I believe would actually help the economy The oil industry gets $4 billion a year in corporate welfare  Basically  they get deductions that those small businesses that Governor Romney refers to  they don\\'t get Now  does anybody think that ExxonMobil needs some extra money  when they\\'re making money every time you go to the pump  w hy wouldn\\'t we want to eliminate that  w hy wouldn\\'t we eliminate tax breaks for corporate jets  My attitude is  if you got a corporate jet  you can probably afford to pay full freight  not get a special break for it w hen it comes to corporate taxes  Governor Romney has said he wants to  in a revenue neutral way  close loopholes  deductions    he hasn\\'t identified which ones they are    but that thereby bring down the corporate rate w ell  I want to do the same thing  but I\\'ve actually identified how we can do that  And part of the way to do it is to not give tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas Right now  you can actually take a deduction for moving a plant overseas  I think most Americans would say that doesn\\'t make sense  And all that raises revenue And so if we take a balanced approach  what that then allows us to do is also to help young people  the way we already have during my administration  make sure that they can afford to go to college OBAMA: It means that the teacher that I met in Las Vegas  a wonderful young lady  who describes to me    she\\'s got 42 kids in her class  The first two weeks she\\'s got them  some of them sitting on the floor until finally they get reassigned  They\\'re using text books that are 10 years old That is not a recipe for growth  That\\'s not how America was built  And so budgets reflect choices Ultimately  we\\'re going to have to make some decisions  And if we\\'re asking for no revenue  then that means that we\\'ve got to get rid of a whole bunch of stuff And the magnitude of the tax cuts that you\\'re talking about  Governor  would end up resulting in severe hardship for people  but more importantly  would not help us grow As I indicated before  when you talk about shifting Medicaid to states  we\\'re talking about potentially a 30    a 30 percent cut in Medicaid over time Now  you know  that may not seem like a big deal when it just is  you know  numbers on a sheet of paper  but if we\\'re talking about a family who\\'s got an autistic kid and is depending on that Medicaid  that\\'s a big problem And governors are creative  There\\'s no doubt about it  But they\\'re not creative enough to make up for 30 percent of revenue on something like Medicaid  w hat ends up happening is some people end up not getting help ROMNEY: Jim  let\\'s    we\\'ve gone on a lot of topics there  and so it\\'s going to take a minute to go from Medicaid to schools   LEHRER: Come back to   (CROSSTALK)ROMNEY:     to oil  to tax breaks  then companies going overseas  So let\\'s go through them one by one First of all  the Department of Energy has said the tax break for oil companies is $2 8 billion a year  And it\\'s actually an accounting treatment  as you know  that\\'s been in place for a hundred years  Now   OBAMA: It\\'s time to end it ROMNEY: And in one year  you provided $90 billion in breaks to the green energy world Now  I like green energy as well  but that\\'s about 50 years\\' worth of what oil and gas receives  And you say Exxon and Mobil  Actually  this $2 8 billion goes largely to small companies  to drilling operators and so forth ROMNEY: But  you know  if we get that tax rate from 35 percent down to 25 percent  why that $2 8 billion is on the table  Of course it\\'s on the table  That\\'s probably not going to survive you get that rate down to 25 percent But don\\'t forget  you put $90 billion  like 50 years\\' worth of breaks  into    into solar and wind  to Solyndra and Fisker and Tester and Ener1  I mean  I had a friend who said you don\\'t just pick the winners and losers  you pick the losers  all right  So this    this is not    this is not the kind of policy you want to have if you want to get America energy secure The second topic  which is you said you get a deduction for taking a plant overseas  Look  I\\'ve been in business for 25 years  I have no idea what you\\'re talking about  I maybe need to get a new accountant LEHRER: Let\\'s   ROMNEY: But    but the idea that you get a break for shipping jobs overseas is simply not the case (CROSSTALK)ROMNEY: w hat we do have right now is a setting where I\\'d like to bring money from overseas back to this country And  finally  Medicaid to states  I\\'m not quite sure where that came in  except this  which is  I would like to take the Medicaid dollars that go to states and say to a state  you\\'re going to get what you got last year  plus inflation  plus 1 percent  and then you\\'re going to manage your care for your poor in the way you think best And I remember  as a governor  when this idea was floated by Tommy Thompson  the governors    Republican and Democrats    said  please let us do that  w e can care for our own poor in so much better and more effective a way than having the federal government tell us how to care for our poor So    so let\\'s state    one of the magnificent things about this country is the whole idea that states are the laboratories of democracy  Don\\'t have the federal government tell everybody what kind of training programs they have to have and what kind of Medicaid they have to have  Let states do this And  by the way  if a state gets in trouble  well  we can step in and see if we can find a way to help them LEHRER: Let\\'s go ROMNEY: But    but the right    the right approach is one which relies on the brilliance of our people and states  not the federal government LEHRER: (inaudible) and we\\'re going on    still on the economy  on another    but another part of it   OBAMA: OK LEHRER: All right  All right  This is segment three  the economy  Entitlements  First    first answer goes to you  two minutes  Mr  President  Do you see a major difference between the two of you on Social Security OBAMA: You know  I suspect that  on Social Security  we\\'ve got a somewhat similar position  Social Security is structurally sound  It\\'s going to have to be tweaked the way it was by Ronald Reagan and Speaker    Democratic Speaker Tip O\\'Neill  But it is    the basic structure is sound But    but I want to talk about the values behind Social Security and Medicare  and then talk about Medicare  because that\\'s the big driver of our deficits right now You know  my grandmother    some of you know    helped to raise me  My grandparents did  My grandfather died a while back  My grandmother died three days before I was elected president  And she was fiercely independent  She worked her way up  only had a high school education  started as a secretary  ended up being the vice president of a local bank  And she ended up living alone by choice And the reason she could be independent was because of Social Security and Medicare  She had worked all her life  put in this money  and understood that there was a basic guarantee  a floor under which she could not go And that\\'s the perspective I bring when I think about what\\'s called entitlements  You know  the name itself implies some sense of dependency on the part of these folks  These are folks who\\'ve worked hard  like my grandmother  and there are millions of people out there who are counting on this OBAMA: So my approach is to say  how do we strengthen the system over the long term  And in Medicare  what we did was we said  we are going to have to bring down the costs if we\\'re going to deal with our long term deficits  but to do that  let\\'s look where some of the money\\'s going $716 billion we were able to save from the Medicare program by no longer overpaying insurance companies by making sure that we weren\\'t overpaying providers  And using that money  we were actually able to lower prescription drug costs for seniors by an average of $600  and we were also able to make a    make a significant dent in providing them the kind of preventive care that will ultimately save money through the    throughout the system So the way for us to deal with Medicare in particular is to lower health care costs  w hen it comes to Social Security  as I said  you don\\'t need a major structural change in order to make sure that Social Security is there for the future LEHRER: w e\\'ll follow up on this First  Governor Romney  you have two minutes on Social Security and entitlements ROMNEY: w ell  Jim  our seniors depend on these programs  and I know anytime we talk about entitlements  people become concerned that something\\'s going to happen that\\'s going to change their life for the worse And the answer is neither the president nor I are proposing any changes for any current retirees or near retirees  either to Social Security or Medicare  So if you\\'re 60 or around 60 or older  you don\\'t need to listen any further But for younger people  we need to talk about what changes are going to be occurring  Oh  I just thought about one  And that is  in fact  I was wrong when I said the president isn\\'t proposing any changes for current retirees  In fact he is on Medicare  On Social Security he\\'s not But on Medicare  for current retirees  he\\'s cutting $716 billion from the program  Now  he says by not overpaying hospitals and providers  Actually just going to them and saying  \"w e\\'re going to reduce the rates you get paid across the board  everybody\\'s going to get a lower rate \" That\\'s not just going after places where there\\'s abuse  That\\'s saying we\\'re cutting the rates  Some 15 percent of hospitals and nursing homes say they won\\'t take anymore Medicare patients under that scenario w e also have 50 percent of doctors who say they won\\'t take more Medicare patients This    we have 4 million people on Medicare Advantage that will lose Medicare Advantage because of those $716 billion in cuts  I can\\'t understand how you can cut Medicare $716 billion for current recipients of Medicare Now  you point out  well  we\\'re putting some back  w e\\'re going to give a better prescription program  That\\'s $1    that\\'s $1 for every $15 you\\'ve cut  They\\'re smart enough to know that\\'s not a good trade I want to take that $716 billion you\\'ve cut and put it back into Medicare  By the way  we can include a prescription program if we need to improve it But the idea of cutting $716 billion from Medicare to be able to balance the additional cost of Obamacare is  in my opinion  a mistake And with regards to young people coming along  I\\'ve got proposals to make sure Medicare and Social Security are there for them without any question LEHRER: Mr  President OBAMA: First of all  I think it\\'s important for Governor Romney to present this plan that he says will only affect folks in the future And the essence of the plan is that you would turn Medicare into a voucher program  It\\'s called premium support  but it\\'s understood to be a voucher program  His running mate   LEHRER: And you don\\'t support that OBAMA: I don\\'t  And let me explain why ROMNEY: Again  that\\'s for future   OBAMA: I understand ROMNEY:     people  right  not for current retirees OBAMA: For    so if you\\'re    if you\\'re 54 or 55  you might want to listen \\'cause this    this will affect you The idea  which was originally presented by Congressman Ryan  your running mate  is that we would give a voucher to seniors and they could go out in the private marketplace and buy their own health insurance The problem is that because the voucher wouldn\\'t necessarily keep up with health care inflation  it was estimated that this would cost the average senior about $6 000 a year Now  in fairness  what Governor Romney has now said is he\\'ll maintain traditional Medicare alongside it  But there\\'s still a problem  because what happens is  those insurance companies are pretty clever at figuring out who are the younger and healthier seniors  They recruit them  leaving the older  sicker seniors in Medicare  And every health care economist that looks at it says  over time  what\\'ll happen is the traditional Medicare system will collapse OBAMA: And then what you\\'ve got is folks like my grandmother at the mercy of the private insurance system precisely at the time when they are most in need of decent health care So  I don\\'t think vouchers are the right way to go  And this is not my own    only my opinion  AARP thinks that the    the savings that we obtained from Medicare bolster the system  lengthen the Medicare trust fund by eight years  Benefits were not affected at all  And ironically  if you repeal Obamacare  and I have become fond of this term  \"Obamacare \" if you repeal it  what happens is those seniors right away are going to be paying $600 more in prescription care  They\\'re now going to have to be paying copays for basic checkups that can keep them healthier And the primary beneficiary of that repeal are insurance companies that are estimated to gain billions of dollars back when they aren\\'t making seniors any healthier  And I don\\'t think that\\'s the right approach when it comes to making sure that Medicare is stronger over the long term LEHRER: w e\\'ll talk about    specifically about health care in a moment  But what    do you support the voucher system  Governor ROMNEY: w hat I support is no change for current retirees and near retirees to Medicare  And the president supports taking $716 billion out of that program LEHRER: And what about the vouchers (CROSSTALK)ROMNEY: So that\\'s    that\\'s number one Number two is for people coming along that are young  what I do to make sure that we can keep Medicare in place for them is to allow them either to choose the current Medicare program or a private plan  Their choice They get to choose    and they\\'ll have at least two plans that will be entirely at no cost to them  So they don\\'t have to pay additional money  no additional $6 000  That\\'s not going to happen  They\\'ll have at least two plans ROMNEY: And by the way  if the government can be as efficient as the private sector and offer premiums that are as low as the private sector  people will be happy to get traditional Medicare or they\\'ll be able to get a private plan I know my own view is I\\'d rather have a private plan  I\\'d just assume not have the government telling me what kind of health care I get  I\\'d rather be able to have an insurance company  If I don\\'t like them  I can get rid of them and find a different insurance company  But people make their own choice The other thing we have to do to save Medicare  w e have to have the benefits high for those that are low income  but for higher income people  we\\'re going to have to lower some of the benefits  w e have to make sure this program is there for the long term  That\\'s the plan that I\\'ve put forward And  by the way the idea came not even from Paul Ryan or    or Senator w yden  who\\'s the co author of the bill with    with Paul Ryan in the Senate  but also it came from Bill    Bill Clinton\\'s chief of staff  This is an idea that\\'s been around a long time  which is saying  hey  let\\'s see if we can\\'t get competition into the Medicare world so that people can get the choice of different plans at lower cost  better quality  I believe in competition OBAMA: Jim  if I    if I can just respond very quickly  first of all  every study has shown that Medicare has lower administrative costs than private insurance does  which is why seniors are generally pretty happy with it And private insurers have to make a profit  Nothing wrong with that  That\\'s what they do  And so you\\'ve got higher administrative costs  plus profit on top of that  And if you are going to save any money through what Governor Romney\\'s proposing  what has to happen is  is that the money has to come from somewhere And when you move to a voucher system  you are putting seniors at the mercy of those insurance companies  And over time  if traditional Medicare has decayed or fallen apart  then they\\'re stuck And this is the reason why AARP has said that your plan would weaken Medicare substantially  And that\\'s why they were supportive of the approach that we took One last point I want to make  w e do have to lower the cost of health care  not just in Medicare and Medicaid    LEHRER: Talk about that in a minute OBAMA:     but    but    but overall LEHRER: OK OBAMA: And so   ROMNEY: That\\'s    that\\'s a big topic  Can we    can we stay on Medicare OBAMA: Is that a    is that a separate topic (CROSSTALK)LEHRER: Yeah  we\\'re going to    yeah  I want to get to it OBAMA: I\\'m sorry LEHRER: But all I want to do is go very quickly   ROMNEY: Let\\'s get back to Medicare LEHRER:     before we leave the economy   ROMNEY: Let\\'s get back to Medicare (CROSSTALK)ROMNEY: The president said that the government can provide the service at lower cost and without a profit LEHRER: All right ROMNEY: If that\\'s the case  then it will always be the best product that people can purchase LEHRER: w ait a minute  Governor ROMNEY: But my experience    my experience the private sector typically is able to provide a better product at a lower cost LEHRER: All right  Can we    can the two of you agree that the voters have a choice    a clear choice between the two   ROMNEY: Absolutely LEHRER:     of you on Medicare ROMNEY: Absolutely OBAMA: Absolutely LEHRER: All right  So to finish quickly  briefly  on the economy  what is your view about the level of federal regulation of the economy right now  Is there too much  And in your case  Mr  President  is there    should there be more Beginning with you  This is not a new two minute segment to start  And we\\'ll go for a few minutes  and then we\\'re going to go to health care  OK ROMNEY: Regulation is essential  You can\\'t have a free market work if you don\\'t have regulation  As a businessperson  I had to have    I need to know the regulations  I needed them there  You couldn\\'t have people opening up banks in their    in their garage and making loans  I mean  you have to have regulations so that you can have an economy work  Every free economy has good regulation  At the same time  regulation can become excessive LEHRER: Is it excessive now  do you think ROMNEY: In some places  yes  Other places  no LEHRER: Like where (CROSSTALK)ROMNEY: No  it can become out of date  And what\\'s happened with some of the legislation that\\'s been passed during the president\\'s term  you\\'ve seen regulation become excessive  and it\\'s hurt    it\\'s hurt the economy  Let me give you an example Dodd Frank was passed  And it includes within it a number of provisions that I think has some unintended consequences that are harmful to the economy  One is it designates a number of banks as too big to fail  and they\\'re effectively guaranteed by the federal government  This is the biggest kiss that\\'s been given to    to New York banks I\\'ve ever seen  This is an enormous boon for them  There\\'ve been 122 community and small banks have closed since Dodd  Frank So there\\'s one example  Here\\'s another  In Dodd Frank   LEHRER: Do you want to repeal Dodd Frank ROMNEY: w ell  I would repeal and replace it  w e\\'re not going to get rid of all regulation  You have to have regulation  And there are some parts of Dodd Frank that make all the sense in the world  You need transparency  you need to have leverage limits for   LEHRER: w ell  here\\'s a specific   (CROSSTALK)ROMNEY: But let\\'s    let\\'s mention    let me mention the other one  Let\\'s talk   (CROSSTALK)LEHRER: No  let\\'s not  Let\\'s let him respond    let\\'s let him respond to this specific on Dodd Frank and what the governor just said OBAMA: I think this is a great example  The reason we have been in such a enormous economic crisis was prompted by reckless behavior across the board Now  it wasn\\'t just on w all Street  You had loan officers were    that were giving loans and mortgages that really shouldn\\'t have been given  because the folks didn\\'t qualify  You had people who were borrowing money to buy a house that they couldn\\'t afford  You had credit agencies that were stamping these as A1 great investments when they weren\\'t But you also had banks making money hand over fist  churning out products that the bankers themselves didn\\'t even understand  in order to make big profits  but knowing that it made the entire system vulnerable So what did we do  w e stepped in and had the toughest reforms on w all Street since the 1930s  w e said you\\'ve got    banks  you\\'ve got to raise your capital requirements  You can\\'t engage in some of this risky behavior that is putting Main Street at risk  w e\\'ve going to make sure that you\\'ve got to have a living will so    so we can know how you\\'re going to wind things down if you make a bad bet so we don\\'t have other taxpayer bailouts OBAMA: In the meantime  by the way  we also made sure that all the help that we provided those banks was paid back every single dime  with interest Now  Governor Romney has said he wants to repeal Dodd Frank And  you know  I appreciate and it appears we\\'ve got some agreement that a marketplace to work has to have some regulation  But in the past  Governor Romney has said he just want to repeal Dodd  Frank  roll it back And so the question is: Does anybody out there think that the big problem we had is that there was too much oversight and regulation of w all Street  Because if you do  then Governor Romney is your candidate  But that\\'s not what I believe ROMNEY: Sorry  but that\\'s just not    that\\'s just not the facts  Look  we have to have regulation on w all Street  That\\'s why I\\'d have regulation  But I wouldn\\'t designate five banks as too big to fail and give them a blank check  That\\'s one of the unintended consequences of Dodd Frank  It wasn\\'t thought through properly  w e need to get rid of that provision because it\\'s killing regional and small banks  They\\'re getting hurt Let me mention another regulation in Dodd Frank  You say we were giving mortgages to people who weren\\'t qualified  That\\'s exactly right  It\\'s one of the reasons for the great financial calamity we had  And so Dodd Frank correctly says we need to have qualified mortgages  and if you give a mortgage that\\'s not qualified  there are big penalties  except they didn\\'t ever go on and define what a qualified mortgage was It\\'s been two years  w e don\\'t know what a qualified mortgage is yet  So banks are reluctant to make loans  mortgages  Try and get a mortgage these days  It\\'s hurt the housing market because Dodd Frank didn\\'t anticipate putting in place the kinds of regulations you have to have  It\\'s not that Dodd Frank always was wrong with too much regulation  Sometimes they didn\\'t come out with a clear regulation I will make sure we don\\'t hurt the functioning of our    of our marketplace and our business  because I want to bring back housing and get good jobs LEHRER: All right  I think we have another clear difference between the two of you  Now  let\\'s move to health care where I know there is a clear difference  and that has to do with the Affordable Care Act  Obamacare  And it\\'s a two minute new    new segment  and that means two minutes each  And you go first  Governor Romney LEHRER: You want it repealed  You want the Affordable Care Act repealed  w hy ROMNEY: I sure do  w ell  in part  it comes  again  from my experience  You know  I was in New Hampshire  A woman came to me and she said  look  I can\\'t afford insurance for myself or my son  I met a couple in Appleton  w isconsin  and they said  we\\'re thinking of dropping our insurance  we can\\'t afford it And the number of small businesses I\\'ve gone to that are saying they\\'re dropping insurance because they can\\'t afford it  the cost of health care is just prohibitive  And    and we\\'ve got to deal with cost And  unfortunately  when    when    when you look at Obamacare  the Congressional Budget Office has said it will cost $2 500 a year more than traditional insurance  So it\\'s adding to cost  And as a matter of fact  when the president ran for office  he said that  by this year  he would have brought down the cost of insurance for each family by $2 500 a family  Instead  it\\'s gone up by that amount  So it\\'s expensive  Expensive things hurt families  So that\\'s one reason I don\\'t want it Second reason  it cuts $716 billion from Medicare to pay for it  I want to put that money back in Medicare for our seniors Number three  it puts in place an unelected board that\\'s going to tell people ultimately what kind of treatments they can have  I don\\'t like that idea Fourth  there was a survey done of small businesses across the country  said  what\\'s been the effect of Obamacare on your hiring plans  And three quarters of them said it makes us less likely to hire people  I just don\\'t know how the president could have come into office  facing 23 million people out of work  rising unemployment  an economic crisis at the    at the kitchen table  and spend his energy and passion for two years fighting for Obamacare instead of fighting for jobs for the American people  It has killed jobs And the best course for health care is to do what we did in my state: craft a plan at the state level that fits the needs of the state  And then let\\'s focus on getting the costs down for people  rather than raising it with the $2 500 additional premium LEHRER: Mr  President  the argument against repeal  OBAMA: w ell  four years ago  when I was running for office  I was traveling around and having those same conversations that Governor Romney talks about  And it wasn\\'t just that small businesses were seeing costs skyrocket and they couldn\\'t get affordable coverage even if they wanted to provide it to their employees  It wasn\\'t just that this was the biggest driver of our federal deficit  our overall health care costs  but it was families who were worried about going bankrupt if they got sick  millions of families  all across the country If they had a pre existing condition  they might not be able to get coverage at all  If they did have coverage  insurance companies might impose an arbitrary limit  And so as a consequence  they\\'re paying their premiums  somebody gets really sick  lo and behold  they don\\'t have enough money to pay the bills  because the insurance companies say that they\\'ve hit the limit So we did work on this  alongside working on jobs  because this is part of making sure that middle class families are secure in this country And let me tell you exactly what Obamacare did  Number one  if you\\'ve got health insurance  it doesn\\'t mean a government takeover  You keep your own insurance  You keep your own doctor  But it does say insurance companies can\\'t jerk you around  They can\\'t impose arbitrary lifetime limits  They have to let you keep your kid on their insurance    your insurance plan until you\\'re 26 years old  And it also says that you\\'re going to have to get rebates if insurance companies are spending more on administrative costs and profits than they are on actual care Number two  if you don\\'t have health insurance  we\\'re essentially setting up a group plan that allows you to benefit from group rates that are typically 18 percent lower than if you\\'re out there trying to get insurance on the individual market Now  the last point I\\'d make before   LEHRER: Two minutes    two minutes is up  sir OBAMA: No  I think    I had five seconds before you interrupted me  was    (LAUGHTER)    the irony is that we\\'ve seen this model work really well in Massachusetts  because Governor Romney did a good thing  working with Democrats in the state to set up what is essentially the identical model and as a consequence people are covered there  It hasn\\'t destroyed jobs  And as a consequence  we now have a system in which we have the opportunity to start bringing down costs  as opposed to just leaving millions of people out in the cold LEHRER: Your five seconds went away a long time ago All right  Governor  Governor  tell    tell the president directly why you think what he just said is wrong about Obamacare ROMNEY: w ell  I did with my first statement (CROSSTALK)ROMNEY: First of all  I like the way we did it in Massachusetts  I like the fact that in my state  we had Republicans and Democrats come together and work together  w hat you did instead was to push through a plan without a single Republican vote  As a matter of fact  when Massachusetts did something quite extraordinary    elected a Republican senator to stop Obamacare  you pushed it through anyway So entirely on a partisan basis  instead of bringing America together and having a discussion on this important topic  you pushed through something that you and Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid thought was the best answer and drove it through w hat we did in a legislature 87 percent Democrat  we worked together; 200 legislators in my legislature  only two voted against the plan by the time we were finished  w hat were some differences  w e didn\\'t raise taxes  You\\'ve raised them by $1 trillion under Obamacare  w e didn\\'t cut Medicare  Of course  we don\\'t have Medicare  but we didn\\'t cut Medicare by $716 billion ROMNEY: w e didn\\'t put in place a board that can tell people ultimately what treatments they\\'re going to receive  w e didn\\'t also do something that I think a number of people across this country recognize  which is put    put people in a position where they\\'re going to lose the insurance they had and they wanted Right now  the CBO says up to 20 million people will lose their insurance as Obamacare goes into effect next year  And likewise  a study by McKinsey and Company of American businesses said 30 percent of them are anticipating dropping people from coverage So for those reasons  for the tax  for Medicare  for this board  and for people losing their insurance  this is why the American people don\\'t want Medicare    don\\'t want Obamacare  It\\'s why Republicans said  do not do this  and the Republicans had    had the plan  They put a plan out  They put out a plan  a bipartisan plan  It was swept aside I think something this big  this important has to be done on a bipartisan basis  And we have to have a president who can reach across the aisle and fashion important legislation with the input from both parties OBAMA: Governor Romney said this has to be done on a bipartisan basis  This was a bipartisan idea  In fact  it was a Republican idea  And Governor Romney at the beginning of this debate wrote and said what we did in Massachusetts could be a model for the nation And I agree that the Democratic legislators in Massachusetts might have given some advice to Republicans in Congress about how to cooperate  but the fact of the matter is  we used the same advisers  and they say it\\'s the same plan It    when Governor Romney talks about this board  for example  unelected board that we\\'ve created  what this is  is a group of health care experts  doctors  et cetera  to figure out  how can we reduce the cost of care in the system overall Because there    there are two ways of dealing with our health care crisis  One is to simply leave a whole bunch of people uninsured and let them fend for themselves  to let businesses figure out how long they can continue to pay premiums until finally they just give up  and their workers are no longer getting insured  and that\\'s been the trend line Or  alternatively  we can figure out  how do we make the cost of care more effective  And there are ways of doing it So at Cleveland Clinic  one of the best health care systems in the world  they actually provide great care cheaper than average  And the reason they do is because they do some smart things  They    they say  if a patient\\'s coming in  let\\'s get all the doctors together at once  do one test instead of having the patient run around with 10 tests  Let\\'s make sure that we\\'re providing preventive care so we\\'re catching the onset of something like diabetes  Let\\'s    let\\'s pay providers on the basis of performance as opposed to on the basis of how many procedures they\\'ve    they\\'ve engaged in Now  so what this board does is basically identifies best practices and says  let\\'s use the purchasing power of Medicare and Medicaid to help to institutionalize all these good things that we do And the fact of the matter is that  when Obamacare is fully implemented  we\\'re going to be in a position to show that costs are going down  And over the last two years  health care premiums have gone up    it\\'s true    but they\\'ve gone up slower than any time in the last 50 years  So we\\'re already beginning to see progress  In the meantime  folks out there with insurance  you\\'re already getting a rebate Let me make one last point  Governor Romney says  we should replace it  I\\'m just going to repeal it  but    but we can replace it with something  But the problem is  he hasn\\'t described what exactly we\\'d replace it with  other than saying we\\'re going to leave it to the states OBAMA: But the fact of the matter is that some of the prescriptions that he\\'s offered  like letting you buy insurance across state lines  there\\'s no indication that that somehow is going to help somebody who\\'s got a pre existing condition be able to finally buy insurance  In fact  it\\'s estimated that by repealing Obamacare  you\\'re looking at 50 million people losing health insurance   LEHRER: Let\\'s   OBAMA:     at a time when it\\'s vitally important LEHRER: Let\\'s let the governor explain what you would do   ROMNEY: w ell   LEHRER:     if Obamacare is repealed  How would you replace it (CROSSTALK)ROMNEY: w ell  actually it\\'s    it\\'s    it\\'s a lengthy description  But  number one  preexisting conditions are covered under my plan  Number two  young people are able to stay on their family plan  That\\'s already offered in the private marketplace  You don\\'t have to have the government mandate that for that to occur But let\\'s come back to something the president and I agree on  which is the key task we have in health care is to get the cost down so it\\'s more affordable for families  And then he has as a model for doing that a board of people at the government  an unelected board  appointed board  who are going to decide what kind of treatment you ought to have (CROSSTALK)ROMNEY: In my opinion  the government is not effective in    in bringing down the cost of almost anything  As a matter of fact  free people and free enterprises trying to find ways to do things better are able to be more effective in bringing down the cost than the government will ever be Your example of the Cleveland Clinic is my case in point  along with several others I could describe This is the private market  These are small    these are enterprises competing with each other  learning how to do better and better jobs  I used to consult to businesses    excuse me  to hospitals and to health care providers  I was astonished at the creativity and innovation that exists in the American people In order to bring the cost of health care down  we don\\'t need to have a board of 15 people telling us what kinds of treatments we should have  w e instead need to put insurance plans  providers  hospitals  doctors on target such that they have an incentive  as you say  performance pay  for doing an excellent job  for keeping costs down  and that\\'s happening  Innermountain Healthcare does it superbly well  Mayo Clinic is doing it superbly well  Cleveland Clinic  others ROMNEY: But the right answer is not to have the federal government take over health care and start mandating to the providers across America  telling a patient and a doctor what kind of treatment they can have That\\'s the wrong way to go  The private market and individual responsibility always work best OBAMA: Let me just point out first of all this board that we\\'re talking about can\\'t make decisions about what treatments are given  That\\'s explicitly prohibited in the law  But let\\'s go back to what Governor Romney indicated  that under his plan  he would be able to cover people with preexisting conditions w ell  actually Governor  that isn\\'t what your plan does  w hat your plan does is to duplicate what\\'s already the law  which says if you are out of health insurance for three months  then you can end up getting continuous coverage and an insurance company can\\'t deny you if you\\'ve    if it\\'s been under 90 days But that\\'s already the law and that doesn\\'t help the millions of people out there with preexisting conditions  There\\'s a reason why Governor Romney set up the plan that he did in Massachusetts  It wasn\\'t a government takeover of health care  It was the largest expansion of private insurance  But what it does say is that \"insurers  you\\'ve got to take everybody \"Now  that also means that you\\'ve got more customers  But when    when Governor Romney says that he\\'ll replace it with something  but can\\'t detail how it will be in fact replaced and the reason he set up the system he did in Massachusetts was because there isn\\'t a better way of dealing with the preexisting conditions problem OBAMA: It just reminds me of  you know  he says that he\\'s going to close deductions and loopholes for his tax plan  That\\'s how it\\'s going to be paid for  but we don\\'t know the details  He says that he\\'s going to replace Dodd Frank  w all Street reform  but we don\\'t know exactly which ones  He won\\'t tell us  He now says he\\'s going to replace Obamacare and ensure that all the good things that are in it are going to be in there and you don\\'t have to worry And at some point  I think the American people have to ask themselves  is the reason that Governor Romney is keeping all these plans to replace secret because they\\'re too good  Is it    is it because that somehow middle class families are going to benefit too much from them No  The reason is  is because  when we reform w all Street  when we tackle the problem of pre existing conditions  then  you know  these are tough problems and we\\'ve got to make choices  And the choices we\\'ve made have been ones that ultimately are benefiting middle class families all across the country LEHRER: w e\\'re going to move to   ROMNEY: No  I    I have to respond to that LEHRER: No  but   ROMNEY: w hich is    which is my experience as a governor is if I come in and    and lay down a piece of legislation and say  \"It\\'s my way or the highway \" I don\\'t get a lot done  w hat I do is the same way that Tip O\\'Neill and Ronald Reagan worked together some years ago  w hen Ronald Reagan ran for office  he laid out the principles that he was going to foster  He said he was going to lower tax rates  He said he was going to broaden the base  You\\'ve said the same thing  you\\'re going to simplify the tax code  broaden the base Those are my principles  I want to bring down the tax burden on middle income families  And I\\'m going to work together with Congress to say  OK  what    what are the various ways we could bring down deductions  for instance  One way  for instance  would be to have a single number  Make up a number  $25 000  $50 000  Anybody can have deductions up to that amount  And then that number disappears for high income people  That\\'s one way one could do it  One could follow Bowles Simpson as a model and take deduction by deduction and make differences that way  There are alternatives to accomplish the objective I have  which is to bring down rates  broaden the base  simplify the code  and create incentives for growth  And with regards to health care  you had remarkable details with regards to my pre existing condition plan  You obviously studied up on    on my plan  In fact  I do have a plan that deals with people with pre existing conditions  That\\'s part of my health care plan  And what we did in Massachusetts is a model for the nation state by state  And I said that at that time The federal government taking over health care for the entire nation and whisking aside the 10th Amendment  which gives states the rights for these kinds of things  is not the course for America to have a stronger  more vibrant economy LEHRER: That is a terrific segue to our next segment  and is the role of government  And    and let\\'s see  Role of government  And it is    you are first on this  Mr  President  And the question is this  Do you believe  both of you    but you had the first two minutes on this  Mr  President    do you believe there\\'s a fundamental difference between the two of you as to how you view the mission of the federal government OBAMA: w ell  I definitely think there are differences LEHRER: And do you    yeah OBAMA: The first role of the federal government is to keep the American people safe  That\\'s its most basic function  And as commander in chief  that is something that I\\'ve worked on and thought about every single day that I\\'ve been in the Oval Office But I also believe that government has the capacity  the federal government has the capacity to help open up opportunity and create ladders of opportunity and to create frameworks where the American people can succeed Look  the genius of America is the free enterprise system and freedom and the fact that people can go out there and start a business  work on an idea  make their own decisions OBAMA: But as Abraham Lincoln understood  there are also some things we do better together  So  in the middle of the Civil w ar  Abraham Lincoln said  let\\'s help to finance the Transcontinental Railroad  let\\'s start the National Academy of Sciences  let\\'s start land grant colleges  because we want to give these gateways of opportunity for all Americans  because if all Americans are getting opportunity  we\\'re all going to be better off  That doesn\\'t restrict people\\'s freedom  That enhances it And so what I\\'ve tried to do as president is to apply those same principles And when it comes to education what I\\'ve said is we\\'ve got to reform schools that are not working  w e use something called Race to the Top  w asn\\'t a top down approach  Governor  w hat we\\'ve said is to states  we\\'ll give you more money if you initiate reforms  And as a consequence  you had 46 states around the country who have made a real difference But what I\\'ve also said is let\\'s hire another 100 000 math and science teachers to make sure we maintain our technological lead and our people are skilled and able to succeed  And hard pressed states right now can\\'t all do that  In fact we\\'ve seen layoffs of hundreds of thousands of teachers over the last several years  and Governor Romney doesn\\'t think we need more teachers  I do  because I think that that is the kind of investment where the federal government can help It can\\'t do it all  but it can make a difference  And as a consequence we\\'ll have a better trained workforce and that will create jobs because companies want to locate in places where we\\'ve got a skilled workforce LEHRER: Two minutes  Governor  on the role of government  Your view ROMNEY: w ell  first  I love great schools  Massachusetts  our schools are ranked number one of all 50 states  And the key to great schools  great teachers So I reject the idea that I don\\'t believe in great teachers or more teachers  Every school district  every state should make that decision on their own The role of government: Look behind us  The Constitution and the Declaration of Independence  The role of government is to promote and protect the principles of those documents ROMNEY: First  life and liberty  w e have a responsibility to protect the lives and liberties of our people  and that means a military second to none  I do not believe in cutting our military  I believe in maintaining the strength of America\\'s military Second  in that line that says we are endowed by our creator with our rights  I believe we must maintain our commitment to religious tolerance and freedom in this country  That statement also says that we are endowed by our creator with the right to pursue happiness as we choose  I interpret that as  one  making sure that those people who are less fortunate and can\\'t care for themselves are cared by    by one another w e\\'re a nation that believes that we\\'re all children of the same god and we care for those that have difficulties  those that are elderly and have problems and challenges  those that are disabled  w e care for them  And we    we look for discovery and innovation  all these things desired out of the American heart to provide the pursuit of happiness for our citizens But we also believe in maintaining for individuals the right to pursue their dreams and not to have the government substitute itself for the rights of free individuals  And what we\\'re seeing right now is  in my view  a    a trickle down government approach  which has government thinking it can do a better job than free people pursuing their dreams  And it\\'s not working And the proof of that is 23 million people out of work  The proof of that is 1 out of 6 people in poverty  The proof of that is we\\'ve gone from 32 million on food stamps to 47 million on food stamps  The proof of that is that 50 percent of college graduates this year can\\'t find work LEHRER: All right ROMNEY: w e know that the path we\\'re taking is not working  It\\'s time for a new path LEHRER: All right  Let\\'s go through some specifics in terms of what    how each of you views the role of government  How do    education  Does the federal government have a responsibility to improve the quality of public education in America ROMNEY: w ell  the primary responsibility for education is    is  of course  at the state and local level  But the federal government also can play a very important role  And I    and I agree with Secretary Arne Duncan  he\\'s    some ideas he\\'s put forward on Race to the Top  not all of them  but some of them I agree with and    and congratulate him for pursuing that  The federal government can get local and    and state schools to do a better job My own view  by the way  is I\\'ve added to that  I happen to believe  I want the kids that are getting federal dollars from IDEA or Title I    these are disabled kids or    or    or poor kids or    or lower income kids  rather  I want them to be able to go to the school of their choice So all federal funds  instead of going to the    to the state or to the school district  I\\'d have go  if you will  follow the child and let the parent and the child decide where to send their    their    their student LEHRER: How do you see the federal government\\'s responsibility to  as I say  to improve the quality of public education in this country OBAMA: w ell  as I\\'ve indicated  I think that it has a significant role to play  Through our Race to the Top program  we\\'ve worked with Republican and Democratic governors to initiate major reforms  and they\\'re having an impact right now LEHRER: Do you think you have a difference with your views and    and those of Governor Romney on    about education and the federal government OBAMA: You know  this is where budgets matter  because budgets reflect choices  So when Governor Romney indicates that he wants to cut taxes and potentially benefit folks like me and him  and to pay for it we\\'re having to initiate significant cuts in federal support for education  that makes a difference You know  his    his running mate  Congressman Ryan  put forward a budget that reflects many of the principles that Governor Romney\\'s talked about  And it wasn\\'t very detailed  This seems to be a trend  But    but what it did do is to    if you extrapolated how much money we\\'re talking about  you\\'d look at cutting the education budget by up to 20 percent OBAMA: w hen it comes to community colleges  we are seeing great work done out there all over the country because we have the opportunity to train people for jobs that exist right now  And one of the things I suspect Governor Romney and I probably agree on is getting businesses to work with community colleges so that they\\'re setting up their training programs   LEHRER: Do you    do you agree  Governor OBAMA: Let me just finish the point (CROSSTALK)OBAMA: The    where they\\'re partnering so that they\\'re designing training programs  And people who are going through them know that there\\'s a job waiting for them if they complete it  That makes a big difference  but that requires some federal support Let me just say one final example  w hen it comes to making college affordable  whether it\\'s two year or four year  one of the things that I did as president was we were sending $60 billion to banks and lenders as middlemen for the student loan program  even though the loans were guaranteed  So there was no risk for the banks or the lenders  but they were taking billions out of the system And we said  \"w hy not cut out the middleman \" And as a consequence  what we\\'ve been able to do is to provide millions more students assistance  lower or keep low interest rates on student loans  And this is an example of where our priorities make a difference Governor Romney  I genuinely believe cares about education  but when he tells a student that  you know  \"you should borrow money from your parents to go to college \" you know  that indicates the degree to which  you know  there may not be as much of a focus on the fact that folks like myself  folks like Michelle  kids probably who attend University of Denver  just don\\'t have that option And for us to be able to make sure that they\\'ve got that opportunity and they can walk through that door  that is vitally important not just to those kids  It\\'s how we\\'re going to grow this economy over the long term LEHRER: w e\\'re running out of time  gentlemen (CROSSTALK) LEHRER: Governor ROMNEY: Mr  President  Mr  President  you\\'re entitled as the president to your own airplane and to your own house  but not to your own facts  All right  I\\'m not going to cut education funding  I don\\'t have any plan to cut education funding and    and grants that go to people going to college  I\\'m planning on (inaudible) to grow  So I\\'m not planning on making changes there But you make a very good point  which is that the place you put your money just makes a pretty clear indication of where your heart is  You put $90 billion into    into green jobs  And I    look  I\\'m all in favor of green energy  $90 billion  that would have    that would have hired 2 million teachers  $90 billion And these businesses  many of them have gone out of business  I think about half of them  of the ones have been invested in have gone out of business  A number of them happened to be owned by people who were contributors to your campaigns Look  the right course for America\\'s government  we were talking about the role of government  is not to become the economic player  picking winners and losers  telling people what kind of health treatment they can receive  taking over the health care system that has existed in this country for a long  long time and has produced the best health records in the world The right answer for government is say  How do we make the private sector become more efficient and more effective  How do we get schools to be more competitive  Let\\'s grade them  I propose we grade our schools so parents know which schools are succeeding and failing  so they can take their child to a    to a school that he\\'s being more successful I don\\'t want to cut our commitment to education  I wanted to make it more effective and efficient  And by the way  I\\'ve had that experience  I don\\'t just talk about it  I\\'ve been there  Massachusetts schools are ranked number one in the nation  This is not because I didn\\'t have commitment to education  It\\'s because I care about education for all of our kids LEHRER: All right  gentlemen   (CROSSTALK)LEHRER: Excuse me (inaudible)  Excuse me  sir  w e\\'ve got    we\\'ve got    barely have three minutes left  I\\'m not going to grade the two of you and say your answers have been too long or I\\'ve done a poor job OBAMA: You\\'ve done a great job LEHRER: Oh  well  no  But the fact is government    the role of government and governing  we\\'ve lost a pod in other words  So we only have three    three minutes left in the    in the debate before we go to your closing statements  And so I want to ask finally here  and remember  we\\'ve got three minutes total time here    and the question is this  Many of the legislative functions of the federal government right now are in a state of paralysis as a result of partisan gridlock  If elected  in your case  if re elected  in your case  what would you do about that Governor ROMNEY: Jim  I had the great experience    it didn\\'t seem like it at the time    of being elected in a state where my legislature was 87 percent Democrat  And that meant I figured out from day one I had to get along and I had to work across the aisle to get anything done  w e drove our schools to be number one in the nation  w e cut taxes 19 times LEHRER: But what would you do as president ROMNEY: w e    as president  I will sit on day one    actually  the day after I get elected    I\\'ll sit down with leaders    the Democratic leaders  as well as Republican leaders  and continue    as we did in my state    we met every Monday for a couple hours  talked about the issues and the challenges in the    in the    in our state in that case  w e have to work on a collaborative basis  not because we\\'re going to compromise our principle  but because there\\'s common ground And the challenges America faces right now    look  the reason I\\'m in this race is there are people that are really hurting today in this country  And we face    this deficit could crush the future generations  w hat\\'s happening in the Middle East  there are developments around the world that are of real concern LEHRER: All right ROMNEY: And Republicans and Democrats both love America  But we need to have leadership    leadership in w ashington that will actually bring people together and get the job done and could not care less if    if it\\'s a Republican or a Democrat  I\\'ve done it before  I\\'ll do it again LEHRER: Mr  President OBAMA: w ell  first of all  I think Governor Romney\\'s going to have a busy first day  because he\\'s also going to repeal Obamacare  which will not be very popular among Democrats as you\\'re sitting down with them (LAUGHTER)But  look  my philosophy has been  I will take ideas from anybody  Democrat or Republican  as long as they\\'re advancing the cause of making middle class families stronger and giving ladders of opportunity to the middle class  That\\'s how we cut taxes for middle  class families and small businesses  That\\'s how we cut a trillion dollars of spending that wasn\\'t advancing that cause  That\\'s how we signed three trade deals into law that are helping us to double our exports and sell more American products around the world  That\\'s how we repealed \"don\\'t ask/don\\'t tell \" That\\'s how we ended the war in Iraq  as I promised  and that\\'s how we\\'re going to wind down the war in Afghanistan  That\\'s how we went after Al Qaida and bin Laden So we\\'ve    we\\'ve seen progress even under Republican control of the House of Representatives  But  ultimately  part of being principled  part of being a leader is  A  being able to describe exactly what it is that you intend to do  not just saying  \"I\\'ll sit down \" but you have to have a plan Number two  what\\'s important is occasionally you\\'ve got to say no  to    to    to folks both in your own party and in the other party  And  you know  yes  have we had some fights between me and the Republicans when    when they fought back against us reining in the excesses of w all Street  Absolutely  because that was a fight that needed to be had w hen    when we were fighting about whether or not we were going to make sure that Americans had more security with their health insurance and they said no  yes  that was a fight that we needed to have LEHRER: All rightOBAMA: And so part of leadership and governing is both saying what it is that you are for  but also being willing to say no to some things  And I\\'ve got to tell you  Governor Romney  when it comes to his own party during the course of this campaign  has not displayed that willingness to say no to some of the more extreme parts of his party LEHRER: That brings us to closing statements  It was a coin toss  Governor Romney  you won the toss and you elected to go last  so you have a closing two minutes  Mr  President OBAMA: w ell  Jim  I want to thank you  and I want to thank Governor Romney  because I think was a terrific debate  and I very much appreciate it  And I want to thank the University of Denver You know  four years ago  we were going through a major crisis  And yet my faith and confidence in the American future is undiminished  And the reason is because of its people  because of the woman I met in North Carolina who decided at 55 to go back to school because she wanted to inspire her daughter and now has a job from that new training that she\\'s gotten; because a company in Minnesota who was willing to give up salaries and perks for their executives to make sure that they didn\\'t lay off workers during a recession The auto workers that you meet in Toledo or Detroit take such pride in building the best cars in the world  not just because of a paycheck  but because it gives them that sense of pride  that they\\'re helping to build America  And so the question now is how do we build on those strengths  And everything that I\\'ve tried to do  and everything that I\\'m now proposing for the next four years in terms of improving our education system or developing American energy or making sure that we\\'re closing loopholes for companies that are shipping jobs overseas and focusing on small businesses and companies that are creating jobs here in the United States  or closing our deficit in a responsible  balanced way that allows us to invest in our future All those things are designed to make sure that the American people  their genius  their grit  their determination  is    is channeled and    and they have an opportunity to succeed  And everybody\\'s getting a fair shot  And everybody\\'s getting a fair share    everybody\\'s doing a fair share  and everybody\\'s playing by the same rules You know  four years ago  I said that I\\'m not a perfect man and I wouldn\\'t be a perfect president  And that\\'s probably a promise that Governor Romney thinks I\\'ve kept  But I also promised that I\\'d fight every single day on behalf of the American people  the middle class  and all those who were striving to get into the middle class  I\\'ve kept that promise and if you\\'ll vote for me  then I promise I\\'ll fight just as hard in a second term LEHRER: Governor Romney  your two minute closing ROMNEY: Thank you  Jim  and Mr  President  And thank you for tuning in this evening This is a    this is an important election and I\\'m concerned about America  I\\'m concerned about the direction America has been taking over the last four years I    I know this is bigger than an election about the two of us as individuals  It\\'s bigger than our respective parties  It\\'s an election about the course of America  w hat kind of America do you want to have for yourself and for your children And there really are two very different paths that we began speaking about this evening  and over the course of this month we\\'re going to have two more presidential debates and a vice presidential debate  w e\\'re talk about those two paths But they lead in very different directions  And it\\'s not just looking to our words that you have to take in evidence of where they go  You can look at the record There\\'s no question in my mind that if the president were to be reelected you\\'ll continue to see a middle class squeeze with incomes going down and prices going up I\\'ll get incomes up again You\\'ll see chronic unemployment  w e\\'ve had 43 straight months with unemployment above 8 percent If I\\'m president I will create    help create 12 million new jobs in this country with rising incomes If the president\\'s reelected  Obamacare will be fully installed  In my view that\\'s going to mean a whole different way of life for people who counted on the insurance plan they had in the past  Many will lose it  You\\'re going to see health premiums go up by some $2 500 per family If I\\'m elected we won\\'t have Obama  w e\\'ll put in place the kind of principles that I put in place in my own state and allow each state to craft their own programs to get people insured and we\\'ll focus on getting the cost of health care down If the president were to be reelected you\\'re going to see a $716 billion cut to Medicare  You\\'ll have 4 million people who will lose Medicare Advantage  You\\'ll have hospital and providers that\\'ll no longer accept Medicare patients I\\'ll restore that $716 billion to Medicare And finally  military  The president\\'s reelected you\\'ll see dramatic cuts to our military  The secretary of defense has said these would be even devastating I will not cut our commitment to our military  I will keep America strong and get America\\'s middle class working again Thank you  Jim LEHRER: Thank you  Governor Thank you  Mr  President The next debate will be the vice presidential event on Thursday  October 11th at Centre College in Danville  Kentucky  For now  from the University of Denver  I\\'m Jim Lehrer  Thank you  and good night Â\\xa0',\n",

MISSISSIPPISPEAKERS:U S  SENATOR JOHN MCCAIN (AZ)REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEEU  S  SENATOR BARACK OBAMA (IL)DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEEJIM LEHREREXECUTIVE EDITOR AND ANCHOR  THE NEw SHOUR  PBS[*] LEHRER: Good evening from the Ford Center for the Performing Arts at the University of Mississippi in Oxford  I\\'m Jim Lehrer of the NewsHour on PBS  and I welcome you to the first of the 2008 presidential debates between the Republican nominee  Senator John McCain of Arizona  and the Democratic nominee  Senator Barack Obama of Illinois The Commission on Presidential Debates is the sponsor of this event and the three other presidential and vice presidential debates coming in October Tonight\\'s will primarily be about foreign policy and national security  which  by definition  includes the global financial crisis  It will be divided roughly into nine minute segments Direct exchanges between the candidates and moderator follow ups are permitted after each candidate has two minutes to answer the lead question in an order determined by a coin toss The specific subjects and questions were chosen by me  They have not been shared or cleared with anyone The audience here in the hall has promised to remain silent  no cheers  no applause  no noise of any kind  except right now  as we welcome Senators Obama and McCain (APPLAUSE)Let me begin with something General Eisenhower said in his 1952 presidential campaign  Quote  \"w e must achieve both security and solvency  In fact  the foundation of military strength is economic strength \" end quote w ith that in mind  the first lead question Gentlemen  at this very moment tonight  where do you stand on the financial recovery plan First response to you  Senator Obama  You have two minutes OBAMA: w ell  thank you very much  Jim  and thanks to the commission and the University of Mississippi  Ole Miss  for hosting us tonight  I can\\'t think of a more important time for us to talk about the future of the country You know  we are at a defining moment in our history  Our nation is involved in two wars  and we are going through the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression And although we\\'ve heard a lot about w all Street  those of you on Main Street I think have been struggling for a while  and you recognize that this could have an impact on all sectors of the economy And you\\'re wondering  how\\'s it going to affect me  How\\'s it going to affect my job  How\\'s it going to affect my house  How\\'s it going to affect my retirement savings or my ability to send my children to college So we have to move swiftly  and we have to move wisely  And I\\'ve put forward a series of proposals that make sure that we protect taxpayers as we engage in this important rescue effort Number one  we\\'ve got to make sure that we\\'ve got oversight over this whole process; $700 billion  potentially  is a lot of money Number two  we\\'ve got to make sure that taxpayers  when they are putting their money at risk  have the possibility of getting that money back and gains  if the market    and when the market returns Number three  we\\'ve got to make sure that none of that money is going to pad CEO bank accounts or to promote golden parachutes And  number four  we\\'ve got to make sure that we\\'re helping homeowners  because the root problem here has to do with the foreclosures that are taking place all across the country Now  we also have to recognize that this is a final verdict on eight years of failed economic policies promoted by George Bush  supported by Senator McCain  a theory that basically says that we can shred regulations and consumer protections and give more and more to the most  and somehow prosperity will trickle down It hasn\\'t worked  And I think that the fundamentals of the economy have to be measured by whether or not the middle class is getting a fair shake  That\\'s why I\\'m running for president  and that\\'s what I hope we\\'re going to be talking about tonight LEHRER: Senator McCain  two minutes MCCAIN: w ell  thank you  Jim  And thanks to everybody And I do have a sad note tonight  Senator Kennedy is in the hospital  He\\'s a dear and beloved friend to all of us  Our thoughts and prayers go out to the lion of the Senate I also want to thank the University of Mississippi for hosting us tonight And  Jim  I    I\\'ve been not feeling too great about a lot of things lately  So have a lot of Americans who are facing challenges  But I\\'m feeling a little better tonight  and I\\'ll tell you why Because as we\\'re here tonight in this debate  we are seeing  for the first time in a long time  Republicans and Democrats together  sitting down  trying to work out a solution to this fiscal crisis that we\\'re in And have no doubt about the magnitude of this crisis  And we\\'re not talking about failure of institutions on w all Street  w e\\'re talking about failures on Main Street  and people who will lose their jobs  and their credits  and their homes  if we don\\'t fix the greatest fiscal crisis  probably in    certainly in our time  and I\\'ve been around a little while But the point is    the point is  we have finally seen Republicans and Democrats sitting down and negotiating together and coming up with a package This package has transparency in it  It has to have accountability and oversight  It has to have options for loans to failing businesses  rather than the government taking over those loans  w e have to    it has to have a package with a number of other essential elements to it And  yes  I went back to w ashington  and I met with my Republicans in the House of Representatives  And they weren\\'t part of the negotiations  and I understand that  And it was the House Republicans that decided that they would be part of the solution to this problem But I want to emphasize one point to all Americans tonight  This isn\\'t the beginning of the end of this crisis  This is the end of the beginning  if we come out with a package that will keep these institutions stable And we\\'ve got a lot of work to do  And we\\'ve got to create jobs  And one of the areas  of course  is to eliminate our dependence on foreign oil LEHRER: All right  let\\'s go back to my question  How do you all stand on the recovery plan  And talk to each other about it  w e\\'ve got five minutes  w e can negotiate a deal right here But  I mean  are you    do you favor this plan  Senator Obama  and you  Senator McCain  Do you    are you in favor of this plan OBAMA: w e haven\\'t seen the language yet  And I do think that there\\'s constructive work being done out there  So  for the viewers who are watching  I am optimistic about the capacity of us to come together with a plan The question  I think  that we have to ask ourselves is  how did we get into this situation in the first place Two years ago  I warned that  because of the subprime lending mess  because of the lax regulation  that we were potentially going to have a problem and tried to stop some of the abuses in mortgages that were taking place at the time Last year  I wrote to the secretary of the Treasury to make sure that he understood the magnitude of this problem and to call on him to bring all the stakeholders together to try to deal with it So    so the question  I think  that we\\'ve got to ask ourselves is  yes  we\\'ve got to solve this problem short term  And we are going to have to intervene; there\\'s no doubt about that But we\\'re also going to have to look at  how is it that we shredded so many regulations  w e did not set up a 21st century regulatory framework to deal with these problems  And that in part has to do with an economic philosophy that says that regulation is always bad LEHRER: Are you going to vote for the plan  Senator McCain MCCAIN: I    I hope so  And I   LEHRER: As a United States senator   MCCAIN: Sure LEHRER:     you\\'re going to vote for the plan MCCAIN: Sure  But    but let me    let me point out  I also warned about Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and warned about corporate greed and excess  and CEO pay  and all that  A lot of us saw this train wreck coming But there\\'s also the issue of responsibility  You\\'ve mentioned President Dwight David Eisenhower  President Eisenhower  on the night before the Normandy invasion  went into his room  and he wrote out two letters One of them was a letter congratulating the great members of the military and allies that had conducted and succeeded in the greatest invasion in history  still to this day  and forever And he wrote out another letter  and that was a letter of resignation from the United States Army for the failure of the landings at Normandy Somehow we\\'ve lost that accountability  I\\'ve been heavily criticized because I called for the resignation of the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission  w e\\'ve got to start also holding people accountable  and we\\'ve got to reward people who succeed But somehow in w ashington today    and I\\'m afraid on w all Street    greed is rewarded  excess is rewarded  and corruption    or certainly failure to carry out our responsibility is rewarded As president of the United States  people are going to be held accountable in my administration  And I promise you that that will happen LEHRER: Do you have something directly to say  Senator Obama  to Senator McCain about what he just said OBAMA: w ell  I think Senator McCain\\'s absolutely right that we need more responsibility  but we need it not just when there\\'s a crisis  I mean  we\\'ve had years in which the reigning economic ideology has been what\\'s good for w all Street  but not what\\'s good for Main Street And there are folks out there who\\'ve been struggling before this crisis took place  And that\\'s why it\\'s so important  as we solve this short term problem  that we look at some of the underlying issues that have led to wages and incomes for ordinary Americans to go down  the    a health care system that is broken  energy policies that are not working  because  you know  10 days ago  John said that the fundamentals of the economy are sound LEHRER: Say it directly to him OBAMA: I do not think that they are LEHRER: Say it directly to him OBAMA: w ell  the    John  10 days ago  you said that the fundamentals of the economy are sound  And   MCCAIN: Are you afraid I couldn\\'t hear him (LAUGHTER)LEHRER: I\\'m just determined to get you all to talk to each other  I\\'m going to try OBAMA: The    and I just fundamentally disagree  And unless we are holding ourselves accountable day in  day out  not just when there\\'s a crisis for folks who have power and influence and can hire lobbyists  but for the nurse  the teacher  the police officer  who  frankly  at the end of each month  they\\'ve got a little financial crisis going on They\\'re having to take out extra debt just to make their mortgage payments  w e haven\\'t been paying attention to them  And if you look at our tax policies  it\\'s a classic example LEHRER: So  Senator McCain  do you agree with what Senator Obama just said  And  if you don\\'t  tell him what you disagree with MCCAIN: No  I    look  we\\'ve got to fix the system  w e\\'ve got fundamental problems in the system  And Main Street is paying a penalty for the excesses and greed in w ashington  D C   and in the w all Street So there\\'s no doubt that we have a long way to go  And  obviously  stricter interpretation and consolidation of the various regulatory agencies that weren\\'t doing their job  that has brought on this crisis But I have a fundamental belief in the goodness and strength of the American worker  And the American worker is the most productive  the most innovative  America is still the greatest producer  exporter and importer But we\\'ve got to get through these times  but I have a fundamental belief in the United States of America  And I still believe  under the right leadership  our best days are ahead of us LEHRER: All right  let\\'s go to the next lead question  which is essentially following up on this same subject And you get two minutes to begin with  Senator McCain  And using your word \"fundamental \" are there fundamental differences between your approach and Senator Obama\\'s approach to what you would do as president to lead this country out of the financial crisis MCCAIN: w ell  the first thing we have to do is get spending under control in w ashington  It\\'s completely out of control  It\\'s gone    we have now presided over the largest increase in the size of government since the Great Society w e Republicans came to power to change government  and government changed us  And the    the worst symptom on this disease is what my friend  Tom Coburn  calls earmarking as a gateway drug  because it\\'s a gateway  It\\'s a gateway to out of control spending and corruption And we have former members of Congress now residing in federal prison because of the evils of this earmarking and pork barrel spending You know  we spent $3 million to study the DNA of bears in Montana  I don\\'t know if that was a criminal issue or a paternal issue  but the fact is that it was $3 million of our taxpayers\\' money  And it has got to be brought under control As president of the United States  I want to assure you  I\\'ve got a pen  This one\\'s kind of old  I\\'ve got a pen  and I\\'m going to veto every single spending bill that comes across my desk  I will make them famous  You will know their names Now  Senator Obama  you wanted to know one of the differences  He has asked for $932 million of earmark pork barrel spending  nearly a million dollars for every day that he\\'s been in the United States Senate I suggest that people go up on the w eb site of Citizens Against Government w aste  and they\\'ll look at those projects That kind of thing is not the way to rein in runaway spending in w ashington  D C  That\\'s one of the fundamental differences that Senator Obama and I have LEHRER: Senator Obama  two minutes OBAMA: w ell  Senator McCain is absolutely right that the earmarks process has been abused  which is why I suspended any requests for my home state  whether it was for senior centers or what have you  until we cleaned it up And he\\'s also right that oftentimes lobbyists and special interests are the ones that are introducing these kinds of requests  although that wasn\\'t the case with me But let\\'s be clear: Earmarks account for $18 billion in last year\\'s budget  Senator McCain is proposing    and this is a fundamental difference between us    $300 billion in tax cuts to some of the wealthiest corporations and individuals in the country  $300 billion Now  $18 billion is important; $300 billion is really important  And in his tax plan  you would have CEOs of Fortune 500 companies getting an average of $700 000 in reduced taxes  while leaving 100 million Americans out So my attitude is  we\\'ve got to grow the economy from the bottom up  w hat I\\'ve called for is a tax cut for 95 percent of working families  95 percent And that means that the ordinary American out there who\\'s collecting a paycheck every day  they\\'ve got a little extra money to be able to buy a computer for their kid  to fill up on this gas that is killing them And over time  that  I think  is going to be a better recipe for economic growth than the    the policies of President Bush that John McCain wants to    wants to follow LEHRER: Senator McCain MCCAIN: w ell  again  I don\\'t mean to go back and forth  but he   (CROSSTALK)LEHRER: No  that\\'s fine MCCAIN: Senator Obama suspended those requests for pork barrel projects after he was running for president of the United States  He didn\\'t happen to see that light during the first three years as a member of the United States Senate  $932 million in requests Maybe to Senator Obama it\\'s not a lot of money  But the point is that    you see  I hear this all the time  \"It\\'s only $18 billion \" Do you know that it\\'s tripled in the last five years  Do you know that it\\'s gone completely out of control to the point where it corrupts people  It corrupts people That\\'s why we have  as I said  people under federal indictment and charges  It\\'s a system that\\'s got to be cleaned up I have fought against it my career  I have fought against it  I was called the sheriff  by the    one of the senior members of the Appropriations Committee  I didn\\'t win Miss Congeniality in the United States Senate Now  Senator Obama didn\\'t mention that  along with his tax cuts  he is also proposing some $800 billion in new spending on new programs Now  that\\'s a fundamental difference between myself and Senator Obama  I want to cut spending  I want to keep taxes low  The worst thing we could do in this economic climate is to raise people\\'s taxes OBAMA: I    I don\\'t know where John is getting his figures  Let\\'s just be clear w hat I do is I close corporate loopholes  stop providing tax cuts to corporations that are shipping jobs overseas so that we\\'re giving tax breaks to companies that are investing here in the United States  I make sure that we have a health care system that allows for everyone to have basic coverage I think those are pretty important priorities  And I pay for every dime of it But let\\'s go back to the original point  John  nobody is denying that $18 billion is important  And  absolutely  we need earmark reform  And when I\\'m president  I will go line by line to make sure that we are not spending money unwisely But the fact is that eliminating earmarks alone is not a recipe for how we\\'re going to get the middle class back on track OBAMA: And when you look at your tax policies that are directed primarily at those who are doing well  and you are neglecting people who are really struggling right now  I think that is a continuation of the last eight years  and we can\\'t afford another four LEHRER: Respond directly to him about that  to Senator Obama about that  about the    he\\'s made it twice now  about your tax    your policies about tax cuts MCCAIN: w ell    well  let me give you an example of what Senator Obama finds objectionable  the business tax Right now  in the United States of America  business pays the second highest business taxes in the world  35 percent  Ireland pays 11 percent Now  if you\\'re a business person  and you can locate any place in the world  then  obviously  if you go to the country where it\\'s 11 percent tax versus 35 percent  you\\'re going to be able to create jobs  increase your business  make more investment  et cetera I want to cut that business tax  I want to cut it so that businesses will remain in    in the United States of America and create jobs But  again  I want to return  It\\'s a lot more than $18 billion in pork barrel spending  I can tell you  it\\'s rife  It\\'s throughout The United States Senate will take up a continuing resolution tomorrow or the next day  sometime next week  with 2 000    2 000    look at them  my friends  Look at them  You\\'ll be appalled And Senator Obama is a recent convert  after requesting $932 million worth of pork barrel spending projects So the point is  I want people to have tax cuts  I want every family to have a $5 000 refundable tax credit so they can go out and purchase their own health care  I want to double the dividend from $3 500 to $7 000 for every dependent child in America I know that the worst thing we could possibly do is to raise taxes on anybody  and a lot of people might be interested in Senator Obama\\'s definition of \"rich \"LEHRER: Senator Obama  you have a question for Senator McCain on that OBAMA: w ell  let me just make a couple of points LEHRER: All right OBAMA: My definition    here\\'s what I can tell the American people: 95 percent of you will get a tax cut  And if you make less than $250 000  less than a quarter million dollars a year  then you will not see one dime\\'s worth of tax increase Now  John mentioned the fact that business taxes on paper are high in this country  and he\\'s absolutely right  Here\\'s the problem: There are so many loopholes that have been written into the tax code  oftentimes with support of Senator McCain  that we actually see our businesses pay effectively one of the lowest tax rates in the world And what that means  then  is that there are people out there who are working every day  who are not getting a tax cut  and you want to give them more It\\'s not like you want to close the loopholes  You just want to add an additional tax cut over the loopholes  And that\\'s a problem Just one last point I want to make  since Senator McCain talked about providing a $5 000 health credit  Now  what he doesn\\'t tell you is that he intends to  for the first time in history  tax health benefits So you may end up getting a $5 000 tax credit  Here\\'s the only problem: Your employer now has to pay taxes on the health care that you\\'re getting from your employer  And if you end up losing your health care from your employer  you\\'ve got to go out on the open market and try to buy it It is not a good deal for the American people  But it\\'s an example of this notion that the market can always solve everything and that the less regulation we have  the better off we\\'re going to be MCCAIN: w ell  you know  let me just   LEHRER: w e\\'ve got to go to another lead question MCCAIN: I know we have to  but this is a classic example of walking the walk and talking the talk w e had an energy bill before the United States Senate  It was festooned with Christmas tree ornaments  It had all kinds of breaks for the oil companies  I mean  billions of dollars worth  I voted against it; Senator Obama voted for it OBAMA: John  you want to give oil companies another $4 billion MCCAIN: You\\'ve got to look at our record  You\\'ve got to look at our records  That\\'s the important thing w ho fought against wasteful and earmark spending  w ho has been the person who has tried to keep spending under control w ho\\'s the person who has believed that the best thing for America is    is to have a tax system that is fundamentally fair  And I\\'ve fought to simplify it  and I have proposals to simplify it Let\\'s give every American a choice: two tax brackets  generous dividends  and  two    and let Americans choose whether they want the    the existing tax code or they want a new tax code And so  again  look at the record  particularly the energy bill  But  again  Senator Obama has shifted on a number of occasions  He has voted in the United States Senate to increase taxes on people who make as low as $42 000 a year OBAMA: That\\'s not true  John  That\\'s not true MCCAIN: And that\\'s just a fact  Again  you can look it up OBAMA: Look  it\\'s just not true  And if we want to talk about oil company profits  under your tax plan  John    this is undeniable    oil companies would get an additional $4 billion in tax breaks Now  look  we all would love to lower taxes on everybody  But here\\'s the problem: If we are giving them to oil companies  then that means that there are those who are not going to be getting them  And   MCCAIN: w ith all due respect  you already gave them to the oil companies OBAMA: No  but  John  the fact of the matter is  is that I was opposed to those tax breaks  tried to strip them out  w e\\'ve got an energy bill on the Senate floor right now that contains some good stuff  some stuff you want  including drilling off shore  but you\\'re opposed to it because it would strip away those tax breaks that have gone to oil companies LEHRER: All right  All right  speaking of things that both of you want  another lead question  and it has to do with the rescue    the financial rescue thing that we started    started asking about And what    and the first answer is to you  Senator Obama  As president  as a result of whatever financial rescue plan comes about and the billion  $700 billion  whatever it is it\\'s going to cost  what are you going to have to give up  in terms of the priorities that you would bring as president of the United States  as a result of having to pay for the financial rescue plan OBAMA: w ell  there are a range of things that are probably going to have to be delayed  w e don\\'t yet know what our tax revenues are going to be  The economy is slowing down  so it\\'s hard to anticipate right now what the budget is going to look like next year But there\\'s no doubt that we\\'re not going to be able to do everything that I think needs to be done  There are some things that I think have to be done w e have to have energy independence  so I\\'ve put forward a plan to make sure that  in 10 years\\' time  we have freed ourselves from dependence on Middle Eastern oil by increasing production at home  but most importantly by starting to invest in alternative energy  solar  wind  biodiesel  making sure that we\\'re developing the fuel efficient cars of the future right here in the United States  in Ohio and Michigan  instead of Japan and South Korea w e have to fix our health care system  which is putting an enormous burden on families  Just    a report just came out that the average deductible went up 30 percent on American families They are getting crushed  and many of them are going bankrupt as a consequence of health care  I\\'m meeting folks all over the country  w e have to do that now  because it will actually make our businesses and our families better off The third thing we have to do is we\\'ve got to make sure that we\\'re competing in education  w e\\'ve got to invest in science and technology  China had a space launch and a space walk  w e\\'ve got to make sure that our children are keeping pace in math and in science And one of the things I think we have to do is make sure that college is affordable for every young person in America And I also think that we\\'re going to have to rebuild our infrastructure  which is falling behind  our roads  our bridges  but also broadband lines that reach into rural communities Also  making sure that we have a new electricity grid to get the alternative energy to population centers that are using them So there are some    some things that we\\'ve got to do structurally to make sure that we can compete in this global economy  w e can\\'t shortchange those things  w e\\'ve got to eliminate programs that don\\'t work  and we\\'ve got to make sure that the programs that we do have are more efficient and cost less LEHRER: Are you    what priorities would you adjust  as president  Senator McCain  because of the    because of the financial bailout cost MCCAIN: Look  we  no matter what  we\\'ve got to cut spending  w e have    as I said  we\\'ve let government get completely out of control Senator Obama has the most liberal voting record in the United States Senate  It\\'s hard to reach across the aisle from that far to the left The point    the point is    the point is  we need to examine every agency of government First of all  by the way  I\\'d eliminate ethanol subsidies  I oppose ethanol subsidies I think that we have to return    particularly in defense spending  which is the largest part of our appropriations    we have to do away with cost plus contracts  w e now have defense systems that the costs are completely out of control w e tried to build a little ship called the Littoral Combat Ship that was supposed to cost $140 million  ended up costing $400 million  and we still haven\\'t done it So we need to have fixed cost contracts  w e need very badly to understand that defense spending is very important and vital  particularly in the new challenges we face in the world  but we have to get a lot of the cost overruns under control I know how to do that MCCAIN: I saved the taxpayers $6 8 billion by fighting a contract that was negotiated between Boeing and DOD that was completely wrong  And we fixed it and we killed it and the people ended up in federal prison so I know how to do this because I\\'ve been involved these issues for many  many years  But I think that we have to examine every agency of government and find out those that are doing their job and keep them and find out those that aren\\'t and eliminate them and we\\'ll have to scrub every agency of government LEHRER: But if I hear the two of you correctly neither one of you is suggesting any major changes in what you want to do as president as a result of the financial bailout  Is that what you\\'re saying OBAMA: No  As I said before  Jim  there are going to be things that end up having to be    LEHRER: Like what OBAMA:     deferred and delayed  w ell  look  I want to make sure that we are investing in energy in order to free ourselves from the dependence on foreign oil  That is a big project  That is a multi year project LEHRER: Not willing to give that up OBAMA: Not willing to give up the need to do it but there may be individual components that we can\\'t do  But John is right we have to make cuts  w e right now give $15 billion every year as subsidies to private insurers under the Medicare system  Doesn\\'t work any better through the private insurers  They just skim off $15 billion  That was a give away and part of the reason is because lobbyists are able to shape how Medicare works They did it on the Medicaid prescription drug bill and we have to change the culture  Tom    or John mentioned me being wildly liberal  Mostly that\\'s just me opposing George Bush\\'s wrong headed policies since I\\'ve been in Congress but I think it is that it is also important to recognize I worked with Tom Coburn  the most conservative  one of the most conservative Republicans who John already mentioned to set up what we call a Google for government saying we\\'ll list every dollar of federal spending to make sure that the taxpayer can take a look and see who  in fact  is promoting some of these spending projects that John\\'s been railing about LEHRER: w hat I\\'m trying to get at this is this  Excuse me if I may  senator  Trying to get at that you all    one of you is going to be the president of the United States come January  At the    in the middle of a huge financial crisis that is yet to be resolved  And what I\\'m trying to get at is how this is going to affect you not in very specific    small ways but in major ways and the approach to take as to the presidency MCCAIN: How about a spending freeze on everything but defense  veteran affairs and entitlement programs LEHRER: Spending freeze MCCAIN: I think we ought to seriously consider with the exceptions of caring for our veterans national defense and several other vital issues LEHRER: w ould you go for that OBAMA: The problem with a spending freeze is you\\'re using a hatchet where you need a scalpel  There are some programs that are very important that are under funded  I went to increase early childhood education and the notion that we should freeze that when there may be  for example  this Medicare subsidy  I think  doesn\\'t make sense Let me tell you another place to look for some savings  w e are currently spending $10 billion a month in Iraq when they have a $79 billion surplus  It seems to me that if we\\'re going to be strong at home as well as strong abroad  that we have to look at bringing that war to a close MCCAIN: Look  we are sending $700 billion a year overseas to countries that don\\'t like us very much  Some of that money ends up in the hands of terrorist organizations  w e have to have wind  tide  solar  natural gas  flex fuel cars and all that but we also have to have offshore drilling and we also have to have nuclear power Senator Obama opposes both storing and reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel  You can\\'t get there from here and the fact is that we can create 700 000 jobs by building constructing 45 new nuclear power plants by the year 2030  Nuclear power is not only important as far as eliminating our dependence on foreign oil but it\\'s also responsibility as far as climate change is concerned  An issue I have been involved in for many  many years and I\\'m proud of the work of the work that I\\'ve done there along with Senator Clinton LEHRER: Before we go to another lead question  Let me figure out a way to ask the same question in a slightly different way here  Are you    are you willing to acknowledge both of you that this financial crisis is going to affect the way you rule the country as president of the United States beyond the kinds of things that you have already    I mean  is it a major move  Is it going to have a major affect OBAMA: There\\'s no doubt itâ€™s gonna affect our budgets  There is no doubt about it  Not only    Even if we get all $700 billion back  let\\'s assume the markets recover  we\\'re holding assets long enough that eventually taxpayers get it back and that happened during the Great Depression when Roosevelt purchased a whole bunch of homes  over time  home values went back up and in fact government made a profit  If we\\'re lucky and we do it right  that could potentially happen but in the short term there\\'s an outlay and we may not see that money for a while And because of the economy\\'s slowing down  I think we can also expect less tax revenue so there\\'s no doubt that as president I\\'m going to have to make some tough decision The only point I want to make is this  that in order to make those tough decisions we have to know what our values are and who we\\'re fighting for and what our priorities are and if we are spending $300 billion on tax cuts for people who don\\'t need them and weren\\'t even asking for them  and we are leaving out health care which is crushing on people all across the country  then I think we have made a bad decision and I want to make sure we\\'re not shortchanging our long term priorities MCCAIN: w ell  I want to make sure we\\'re not handing the health care system over to the federal government which is basically what would ultimately happen with Senator Obama\\'s health care plan  I want the families to make decisions between themselves and their doctors  Not the federal government  Look  w e have to obviously cut spending  I have fought to cut spending  Senator Obama has $800 billion in new spending programs  I would suggest he start by canceling some of those new spending program that he has w e can\\'t I think adjust spending around to take care of the very much needed programs  including taking care of our veterans but I also want to say again a healthy economy with low taxes would not raising anyone\\'s taxes is probably the best recipe for eventually having our economy recover And spending restraint has got to be a vital part of that  And the reason  one of the major reasons why we\\'re in the difficulties we are in today is because spending got out of control  w e owe China $500 billion  And spending  I know  can be brought under control because I have fought against excessive spending my entire career  And I got plans to reduce and eliminate unnecessary and wasteful spending and if there\\'s anybody here who thinks there aren\\'t agencies of government where spending can be cut and their budgets slashed they have not spent a lot of time in w ashington OBAMA: I just want to make this point  Jim  John  it\\'s been your president who you said you agreed with 90 percent of the time who presided over this increase in spending  This orgy of spending and enormous deficits you voted for almost all of his budgets  So to stand here and after eight years and say that you\\'re going to lead on controlling spending and  you know  balancing our tax cuts so that they help middle class families when over the last eight years that hasn\\'t happened I think just is  you know  kind of hard to swallow LEHRER: Quick response to Senator Obama MCCAIN: It\\'s well known that I have not been elected Miss Congeniality in the United States Senate nor with the administration  I have opposed the president on spending  on climate change  on torture of prisoner  on   on Guantanamo Bay  On a    on the way that the Iraq w ar was conducted  I have a long record and the American people know me very well and that is independent and a maverick of the Senate and I\\'m happy to say that I\\'ve got a partner that\\'s a good maverick along with me now LEHRER: All right  Let\\'s go another subject  Lead question  two minutes to you  senator McCain  Much has been said about the lessons of Vietnam  w hat do you see as the lessons of Iraq MCCAIN: I think the lessons of Iraq are very clear that you cannot have a failed strategy that will then cause you to nearly lose a conflict  Our initial military success  we went in to Baghdad and everybody celebrated  And then the war was very badly mishandled  I went to Iraq in 2003 and came back and said  we\\'ve got to change this strategy  This strategy requires additional troops  it requires a fundamental change in strategy and I fought for it  And finally  we came up with a great general and a strategy that has succeeded This strategy has succeeded  And we are winning in Iraq  And we will come home with victory and with honor  And that withdrawal is the result of every counterinsurgency that succeeds MCCAIN: And I want to tell you that now that we will succeed and our troops will come home  and not in defeat  that we will see a stable ally in the region and a fledgling democracy The consequences of defeat would have been increased Iranian influence  It would have been increase in sectarian violence  It would have been a wider war  which the United States of America might have had to come back So there was a lot at stake there  And thanks to this great general  David Petraeus  and the troops who serve under him  they have succeeded  And we are winning in Iraq  and we will come home  And we will come home as we have when we have won other wars and not in defeat LEHRER: Two minutes  how you see the lessons of Iraq  Senator Obama OBAMA: w ell  this is an area where Senator McCain and I have a fundamental difference because I think the first question is whether we should have gone into the war in the first place Now six years ago  I stood up and opposed this war at a time when it was politically risky to do so because I said that not only did we not know how much it was going to cost  what our exit strategy might be  how it would affect our relationships around the world  and whether our intelligence was sound  but also because we hadn\\'t finished the job in Afghanistan w e hadn\\'t caught bin Laden  w e hadn\\'t put al Qaeda to rest  and as a consequence  I thought that it was going to be a distraction  Now Senator McCain and President Bush had a very different judgment And I wish I had been wrong for the sake of the country and they had been right  but that\\'s not the case  w e\\'ve spent over $600 billion so far  soon to be $1 trillion  w e have lost over 4 000 lives  w e have seen 30 000 wounded  and most importantly  from a strategic national security perspective  al Qaeda is resurgent  stronger now than at any time since 2001 w e took our eye off the ball  And not to mention that we are still spending $10 billion a month  when they have a $79 billion surplus  at a time when we are in great distress here at home  and we just talked about the fact that our budget is way overstretched and we are borrowing money from overseas to try to finance just some of the basic functions of our government So I think the lesson to be drawn is that we should never hesitate to use military force  and I will not  as president  in order to keep the American people safe  But we have to use our military wisely  And we did not use our military wisely in Iraq LEHRER: Do you agree with that  the lesson of Iraq MCCAIN: The next president of the United States is not going to have to address the issue as to whether we went into Iraq or not  The next president of the United States is going to have to decide how we leave  when we leave  and what we leave behind  That\\'s the decision of the next president of the United States Senator Obama said the surge could not work  said it would increase sectarian violence  said it was doomed to failure  Recently on a television program  he said it exceed our wildest expectations But yet  after conceding that  he still says that he would oppose the surge if he had to decide that again today  Incredibly  incredibly Senator Obama didn\\'t go to Iraq for 900 days and never asked for a meeting with General Petraeus LEHRER: w ell  let\\'s go at some of these things   MCCAIN: Senator Obama is the chairperson of a committee that oversights NATO that\\'s in Afghanistan  To this day  he has never had a hearing LEHRER: w hat about that point MCCAIN: I mean  it\\'s remarkable LEHRER: All right  w hat about that point OBAMA: w hich point  He raised a whole bunch of them LEHRER: I know  OK  let\\'s go to the latter point and we\\'ll back up  The point about your not having been   OBAMA: Look  I\\'m very proud of my vice presidential selection  Joe Biden  who is the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee  and as he explains  and as John well knows  the issues of Afghanistan  the issues of Iraq  critical issues like that  don\\'t go through my subcommittee because they\\'re done as a committee as a whole But that\\'s Senate inside baseball  But let\\'s get back to the core issue here  Senator McCain is absolutely right that the violence has been reduced as a consequence of the extraordinary sacrifice of our troops and our military families They have done a brilliant job  and General Petraeus has done a brilliant job  But understand  that was a tactic designed to contain the damage of the previous four years of mismanagement of this war And so John likes    John  you like to pretend like the war started in 2007  You talk about the surge  The war started in 2003  and at the time when the war started  you said it was going to be quick and easy  You said we knew where the weapons of mass destruction were  You were wrong You said that we were going to be greeted as liberators  You were wrong  You said that there was no history of violence between Shia and Sunni  And you were wrong  And so my question is   (CROSSTALK)LEHRER: Senator Obama   OBAMA:     of judgment  of whether or not    of whether or not    if the question is who is best equipped as the next president to make good decisions about how we use our military  how we make sure that we are prepared and ready for the next conflict  then I think we can take a look at our judgment LEHRER: I have got a lot on the plate here   MCCAIN: I\\'m afraid Senator Obama doesn\\'t understand the difference between a tactic and a strategy  But the important    I\\'d like to tell you  two Fourths of July ago I was in Baghdad  General Petraeus invited Senator Lindsey Graham and me to attend a ceremony where 688 brave young Americans  whose enlistment had expired  were reenlisting to stay and fight for Iraqi freedom and American freedom I was honored to be there  I was honored to speak to those troops  And you know  afterwards  we spent a lot of time with them  And you know what they said to us  They said  let us win  They said  let us win  w e don\\'t want our kids coming back here And this strategy  and this general  they are winning  Senator Obama refuses to acknowledge that we are winning in Iraq OBAMA: That\\'s not true MCCAIN: They just passed an electoral   OBAMA: That\\'s not true MCCAIN: An election law just in the last few days  There is social  economic progress  and a strategy  a strategy of going into an area  clearing and holding  and the people of the country then become allied with you  They inform on the bad guys  And peace comes to the country  and prosperity That\\'s what\\'s happening in Iraq  and it wasn\\'t a tactic LEHRER: Let me see   OBAMA: Jim  Jim  this is a big   MCCAIN: It was a strategy  And that same strategy will be employed in Afghanistan by this great general  And Senator Obama  who after promising not to vote to cut off funds for the troops  did the incredible thing of voting to cut off the funds for the troops in Iraq and Afghanistan OBAMA: Jim  there are a whole bunch of things we have got to answer  First of all  let\\'s talk about this troop funding issue because John always brings this up  Senator McCain cut    Senator McCain opposed funding for troops in legislation that had a timetable  because he didn\\'t believe in a timetable I opposed funding a mission that had no timetable  and was open  ended  giving a blank check to George Bush  w e had a difference on the timetable  w e didn\\'t have a difference on whether or not we were going to be funding troops w e had a legitimate difference  and I absolutely understand the difference between tactics and strategy  And the strategic question that the president has to ask is not whether or not we are employing a particular approach in the country once we have made the decision to be there The question is  was this wise  w e have seen Afghanistan worsen  deteriorate  w e need more troops there  w e need more resources there  Senator McCain  in the rush to go into Iraq  said  you know what  w e\\'ve been successful in Afghanistan  There is nobody who can pose a threat to us there This is a time when bin Laden was still out  and now they\\'ve reconstituted themselves  Secretary of Defense Robert Gates himself acknowledges the war on terrorism started in Afghanistan and it needs to end there But we can\\'t do it if we are not willing to give Iraq back its country  Now  what I\\'ve said is we should end this war responsibly  w e should do it in phases  But in 16 months we should be able to reduce our combat troops  put    provide some relief to military families and our troops and bolster our efforts in Afghanistan so that we can capture and kill bin Laden and crush al Qaeda And right now  the commanders in Afghanistan  as well as Admiral Mullen  have acknowledged that we don\\'t have enough troops to deal with Afghanistan because we still have more troops in Iraq than we did before the surge MCCAIN: Admiral Mullen suggests that Senator Obama\\'s plan is dangerous for America OBAMA: That\\'s not the case MCCAIN: That\\'s what    OBAMA: w hat he said was a precipitous   MCCAIN: That\\'s what Admiral Mullen said OBAMA:     withdrawal would be dangerous  He did not say that  That\\'s not true MCCAIN: And also General Petraeus said the same thing  Osama bin Laden and General Petraeus have one thing in common that I know of  they both said that Iraq is the central battleground Now General Petraeus has praised the successes  but he said those successes are fragile and if we set a specific date for withdrawal    and by the way  Senator Obama\\'s original plan  they would have been out last spring before the surge ever had a chance to succeed And I\\'m    I\\'m    understand why Senator Obama was surprised and said that the surge succeeded beyond his wildest expectations MCCAIN: It didn\\'t exceed beyond mine  because I know that that\\'s a strategy that has worked and can succeed  But if we snatch defeat from the jaws of victory and adopt Senator Obama\\'s plan  then we will have a wider war and it will make things more complicated throughout the region  including in Afghanistan LEHRER: Afghanistan  lead    a new    a new lead question  Now  having resolved Iraq  we\\'ll move to Afghanistan (LAUGHTER)And it goes to you  Senator Obama  and it\\'s a    it picks up on a point that\\'s already been made  Do you think more troops    more U S  troops should be sent to Afghanistan  how many  and when OBAMA: Yes  I think we need more troops  I\\'ve been saying that for over a year now And I think that we have to do it as quickly as possible  because it\\'s been acknowledged by the commanders on the ground the situation is getting worse  not better w e had the highest fatalities among U S  troops this past year than at any time since 2002  And we are seeing a major offensive taking place    Al Qaida and Taliban crossing the border and attacking our troops in a brazen fashion  They are feeling emboldened And we cannot separate Afghanistan from Iraq  because what our commanders have said is we don\\'t have the troops right now to deal with Afghanistan So I would send two to three additional brigades to Afghanistan  Now  keep in mind that we have four times the number of troops in Iraq  where nobody had anything to do with 9/11 before we went in  where  in fact  there was no Al Qaida before we went in  but we have four times more troops there than we do in Afghanistan And that is a strategic mistake  because every intelligence agency will acknowledge that Al Qaida is the greatest threat against the United States and that Secretary of Defense Gates acknowledged the central front    that the place where we have to deal with these folks is going to be in Afghanistan and in Pakistan So here\\'s what we have to do comprehensively  though  It\\'s not just more troops w e have to press the Afghan government to make certain that they are actually working for their people  And I\\'ve said this to President Karzai Number two  we\\'ve got to deal with a growing poppy trade that has exploded over the last several years Number three  we\\'ve got to deal with Pakistan  because Al Qaida and the Taliban have safe havens in Pakistan  across the border in the northwest regions  and although  you know  under George Bush  with the support of Senator McCain  we\\'ve been giving them $10 billion over the last seven years  they have not done what needs to be done to get rid of those safe havens And until we do  Americans here at home are not going to be safe LEHRER: Afghanistan  Senator McCain MCCAIN: First of all  I won\\'t repeat the mistake that I regret enormously  and that is  after we were able to help the Afghan freedom fighters and drive the Russians out of Afghanistan  we basically washed our hands of the region And the result over time was the Taliban  Al Qaida  and a lot of the difficulties we are facing today  So we can\\'t ignore those lessons of history Now  on this issue of aiding Pakistan  if you\\'re going to aim a gun at somebody  George Shultz  our great secretary of state  told me once  you\\'d better be prepared to pull the trigger I\\'m not prepared at this time to cut off aid to Pakistan  So I\\'m not prepared to threaten it  as Senator Obama apparently wants to do  as he has said that he would announce military strikes into Pakistan w e\\'ve got to get the support of the people of    of Pakistan  He said that he would launch military strikes into Pakistan Now  you don\\'t do that  You don\\'t say that out loud  If you have to do things  you have to do things  and you work with the Pakistani government Now  the new president of Pakistan  Kardari (sic)  has got his hands full  And this area on the border has not been governed since the days of Alexander the Great I\\'ve been to w aziristan  I can see how tough that terrain is  It\\'s ruled by a handful of tribes And  yes  Senator Obama calls for more troops  but what he doesn\\'t understand  it\\'s got to be a new strategy  the same strategy that he condemned in Iraq  It\\'s going to have to be employed in Afghanistan And we\\'re going to have to help the Pakistanis go into these areas and obtain the allegiance of the people  And it\\'s going to be tough  They\\'ve intermarried with Al Qaida and the Taliban  And it\\'s going to be tough  But we have to get the cooperation of the people in those areas And the Pakistanis are going to have to understand that that bombing in the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad was a signal from the terrorists that they don\\'t want that government to cooperate with us in combating the Taliban and jihadist elements So we\\'ve got a lot of work to do in Afghanistan  But I\\'m confident  now that General Petraeus is in the new position of command  that we will employ a strategy which not only means additional troops    and  by the way  there have been 20 000 additional troops  from 32 000 to 53 000  and there needs to be more So it\\'s not just the addition of troops that matters  It\\'s a strategy that will succeed  And Pakistan is a very important element in this  And I know how to work with them  And I guarantee you I would not publicly state that I\\'m going to attack them OBAMA: Nobody talked about attacking Pakistan  Here\\'s what I said And if John wants to disagree with this  he can let me know  that  if the United States has Al Qaida  bin Laden  top level lieutenants in our sights  and Pakistan is unable or unwilling to act  then we should take them out Now  I think that\\'s the right strategy; I think that\\'s the right policy And  John  I    you\\'re absolutely right that presidents have to be prudent in what they say  But  you know  coming from you  who  you know  in the past has threatened extinction for North Korea and  you know  sung songs about bombing Iran  I don\\'t know  you know  how credible that is  I think this is the right strategy Now  Senator McCain is also right that it\\'s difficult  This is not an easy situation  You\\'ve got cross border attacks against U S  troops And we\\'ve got a choice  w e could allow our troops to just be on the defensive and absorb those blows again and again and again  if Pakistan is unwilling to cooperate  or we have to start making some decisions And the problem  John  with the strategy that\\'s been pursued was that  for 10 years  we coddled Musharraf  we alienated the Pakistani population  because we were anti democratic  w e had a 20th century mindset that basically said  \"w ell  you know  he may be a dictator  but he\\'s our dictator \"And as a consequence  we lost legitimacy in Pakistan  w e spent $10 billion  And in the meantime  they weren\\'t going after Al Qaida  and they are more powerful now than at any time since we began the war in Afghanistan That\\'s going to change when I\\'m president of the United States MCCAIN: I    I don\\'t think that Senator Obama understands that there was a failed state in Pakistan when Musharraf came to power  Everybody who was around then  and had been there  and knew about it knew that it was a failed state But let me tell you  you know  this business about bombing Iran and all that  let me tell you my record Back in 1983  when I was a brand new United States congressman  the one    the person I admired the most and still admire the most  Ronald Reagan  wanted to send Marines into Lebanon And I saw that  and I saw the situation  and I stood up  and I voted against that  because I was afraid that they couldn\\'t make peace in a place where 300 or 400 or several hundred Marines would make a difference  Tragically  I was right: Nearly 300 Marines lost their lives in the bombing of the barracks And then we had Somalia    then we had the first Gulf w ar  I supported    I supported that I supported us going into Bosnia  when a number of my own party and colleagues was against that operation in Bosnia  That was the right thing to do  to stop genocide and to preserve what was necessary inside of Europe I supported what we did in Kosovo  I supported it because ethnic cleansing and genocide was taking place there And I have a record    and Somalia  I opposed that we should turn    turn the force in Somalia from a peacekeeping force into a peacemaking force  which they were not capable of So I have a record  I have a record of being involved in these national security issues  which involve the highest responsibility and the toughest decisions that any president can make  and that is to send our young men and women into harm\\'s way And I\\'ll tell you  I had a town hall meeting in w olfeboro  New Hampshire  and a woman stood up and she said  \"Senator McCain  I want you to do me the honor of wearing a bracelet with my son\\'s name on it \"He was 22 years old and he was killed in combat outside of Baghdad  Matthew Stanley  before Christmas last year  This was last August  a year ago  And I said  \"I will    I will wear his bracelet with honor \"And this was August  a year ago  And then she said  \"But  Senator McCain  I want you to do everything    promise me one thing  that you\\'ll do everything in your power to make sure that my son\\'s death was not in vain \"That means that that mission succeeds  just like those young people who re enlisted in Baghdad  just like the mother I met at the airport the other day whose son was killed  And they all say to me that we don\\'t want defeat  I know what thatâ€™s like when an army is defeated MCCAIN: A war that I was in  where we had an Army  that it wasn\\'t through any fault of their own  but they were defeated  And I know how hard it is for that    for an Army and a military to recover from that  And it did and we will win this one and we won\\'t come home in defeat and dishonor and probably have to go back if we fail OBAMA: Jim  let me just make a point  I\\'ve got a bracelet  too  from Sergeant   from the mother of Sergeant Ryan David Jopeck (ph)  given to me in green bay  She asked me  can you please make sure another mother is not going through what I\\'m going through No U S  soldier ever dies in vain because they\\'re carrying out the missions of their commander in chief  And we honor all the service that they\\'ve provided  Our troops have performed brilliantly  The question is for the next president  are we making good judgments about how to keep America safe precisely because sending our military into battle is such an enormous step And the point that I originally made is that we took our eye off Afghanistan  we took our eye off the folks who perpetrated 9/11  they are still sending out videotapes and Senator McCain  nobody is talking about defeat in Iraq  but I have to say we are having enormous problems in Afghanistan because of that decision And it is not true you have consistently been concerned about what happened in Afghanistan  At one point  while you were focused on Iraq  you said well  we can \"muddle through\" Afghanistan  You don\\'t muddle through the central front on terror and you don\\'t muddle through going after bin Laden  You don\\'t muddle through stamping out the Taliban I think that is something we have to take seriously  And when I\\'m president  I will LEHRER: New    MCCAIN: You might think that with that kind of concern that Senator Obama would have gone to Afghanistan  particularly given his responsibilities as a subcommittee chairman  By the way  when I\\'m subcommittee chairman  we take up the issues under my subcommittee  But the important thing is    the important thing is I visited Afghanistan and I traveled to w aziristan and I traveled to these places and I know what our security requirements are  I know what our needs are  So the point is that we will prevail in Afghanistan  but we need the new strategy and we need it to succeed But the important thing is  if we suffer defeat in Iraq  which General Petraeus predicts we will  if we adopted Senator Obama\\'s set date for withdrawal  then that will have a calamitous effect in Afghanistan and American national security interests in the region  Senator Obama doesn\\'t seem to understand there is a connected between the two LEHRER: I have some good news and bad news for the two of you  You all are even on time  which is remarkable  considering we\\'ve been going at it    OBAMA: A testimony to you  Jim LEHRER: I don\\'t know about that  But the bad news is all my little five minute things have run over  so  anyhow  we\\'ll adjust as we get there  But the amount of time is even New lead question  And it goes two minutes to you  Senator McCain  what is your reading on the threat from Iran right now to the security of the United States MCCAIN: My reading of the threat from Iran is that if Iran acquires nuclear weapons  it is an existential threat to the State of Israel and it is a threat to other countries in the region because the other countries in the region will feel compelling requirement to acquire nuclear weapons as well Now we cannot allow a second Holocaust  Let\\'s just make that very clear  w hat I have proposed for a long time  and I\\'ve had conversation with foreign leaders about forming a league of democracies  let\\'s be clear and let\\'s have some straight talk  The Russians are preventing significant action in the United Nations Security Council I have proposed a league of democracies  a group of people   a group of countries that share common interests  common values  common ideals  they also control a lot of the world\\'s economic power  w e could impose significant meaningful  painful sanctions on the Iranians that I think could have a beneficial effect The Iranians have a lousy government  so therefore their economy is lousy  even though they have significant oil revenues  So I am convinced that together  we can  with the French  with the British  with the Germans and other countries  democracies around the world  we can affect Iranian behavior But have no doubt  but have no doubt that the Iranians continue on the path to the acquisition of a nuclear weapon as we speak tonight  And it is a threat not only in this region but around the world w hat I\\'d also like to point out the Iranians are putting the most lethal IEDs into Iraq which are killing young Americans  there are special groups in Iran coming into Iraq and are being trained in Iran  There is the Republican Guard in Iran  which Senator Kyl had an amendment in order to declare them a sponsor of terror  Senator Obama said that would be provocative So this is a serious threat  This is a serious threat to security in the world  and I believe we can act and we can act with our friends and allies and reduce that threat as quickly as possible  but have no doubt about the ultimate result of them acquiring nuclear weapons LEHRER: Two minutes on Iran  Senator Obama OBAMA: w ell  let me just correct something very quickly  I believe the Republican Guard of Iran is a terrorist organization  I\\'ve consistently said so  w hat Senator McCain refers to is a measure in the Senate that would try to broaden the mandate inside of Iraq  To deal with Iran And ironically  the single thing that has strengthened Iran over the last several years has been the war in Iraq  Iraq was Iran\\'s mortal enemy  That was cleared away  And what we\\'ve seen over the last several years is Iran\\'s influence grow  They have funded Hezbollah  they have funded Hamas  they have gone from zero centrifuges to 4 000 centrifuges to develop a nuclear weapon So obviously  our policy over the last eight years has not worked  Senator McCain is absolutely right  we cannot tolerate a nuclear Iran  It would be a game changer  Not only would it threaten Israel  a country that is our stalwart ally  but it would also create an environment in which you could set off an arms race in this Middle East Now here\\'s what we need to do  w e do need tougher sanctions  I do not agree with Senator McCain that we\\'re going to be able to execute the kind of sanctions we need without some cooperation with countries like Russia and China that are  I think Senator McCain would agree  not democracies  but have extensive trade with Iran but potentially have an interest in making sure Iran doesn\\'t have a nuclear weapon But we are also going to have to  I believe  engage in tough direct diplomacy with Iran and this is a major difference I have with Senator McCain  this notion that by not talking to people we are punishing them has not worked  It has not worked in Iran  it has not worked in North Korea  In each instance  our efforts at isolation have actually accelerated their efforts to get nuclear weapons  That will change when I\\'m president of the United States LEHRER: Senator  what about talking MCCAIN: Senator Obama twice said in debates he would sit down with Ahmadinejad  Chavez and Raul Castro without precondition  w ithout precondition  Here is Ahmadinenene (ph)  Ahmadinejad  who is  Ahmadinejad  who is now in New York  talking about the extermination of the State of Israel  of wiping Israel off the map  and we\\'re going to sit down  without precondition  across the table  to legitimize and give a propaganda platform to a person that is espousing the extermination of the state of Israel  and therefore then giving them more credence in the world arena and therefore saying  they\\'ve probably been doing the right thing  because you will sit down across the table from them and that will legitimize their illegal behavior The point is that throughout history  whether it be Ronald Reagan  who wouldn\\'t sit down with Brezhnev  Andropov or Chernenko until Gorbachev was ready with glasnost and perestroika Or whether it be Nixon\\'s trip to China  which was preceded by Henry Kissinger  many times before he went  Look  I\\'ll sit down with anybody  but there\\'s got to be pre conditions  Those pre conditions would apply that we wouldn\\'t legitimize with a face to face meeting  a person like Ahmadinejad  Now  Senator Obama said  without preconditions OBAMA: So let\\'s talk about this  First of all  Ahmadinejad is not the most powerful person in Iran  So he may not be the right person to talk to  But I reserve the right  as president of the United States to meet with anybody at a time and place of my choosing if I think it\\'s going to keep America safe And I\\'m glad that Senator McCain brought up the history  the bipartisan history of us engaging in direct diplomacy OBAMA: Senator McCain mentioned Henry Kissinger  who\\'s one of his advisers  who  along with five recent secretaries of state  just said that we should meet with Iran    guess what    without precondition  This is one of your own advisers Now  understand what this means \"without preconditions \" It doesn\\'t mean that you invite them over for tea one day  w hat it means is that we don\\'t do what we\\'ve been doing  which is to say  \"Until you agree to do exactly what we say  we won\\'t have direct contacts with you \"There\\'s a difference between preconditions and preparation  Of course we\\'ve got to do preparations  starting with low level diplomatic talks  and it may not work  because Iran is a rogue regime  But I will point out that I was called naive when I suggested that we need to look at exploring contacts with Iran  And you know what  President Bush recently sent a senior ambassador  Bill Burns  to participate in talks with the Europeans around the issue of nuclear weapons Again  it may not work  but if it doesn\\'t work  then we have strengthened our ability to form alliances to impose the tough sanctions that Senator McCain just mentioned And when we haven\\'t done it  as in North Korea    let me just take one more example    in North Korea  we cut off talks  They\\'re a member of the axis of evil  w e can\\'t deal with them And you know what happened  They went    they quadrupled their nuclear capacity  They tested a nuke  They tested missiles  They pulled out of the nonproliferation agreement  And they sent nuclear secrets  potentially  to countries like Syria w hen we re engaged    because  again  the Bush administration reversed course on this    then we have at least made some progress  although right now  because of the problems in North Korea  we are seeing it on shaky ground And    and I just    so I just have to make this general point that the Bush administration  some of Senator McCain\\'s own advisers all think this is important  and Senator McCain appears resistant He even said the other day that he would not meet potentially with the prime minister of Spain  because he    you know  he wasn\\'t sure whether they were aligned with us  I mean  Spain  Spain is a NATO ally MCCAIN: Of course OBAMA: If we can\\'t meet with our friends  I don\\'t know how we\\'re going to lead the world in terms of dealing with critical issues like terrorism MCCAIN: I\\'m not going to set the w hite House visitors schedule before I\\'m president of the United States  I don\\'t even have a seal yet Look  Dr  Kissinger did not say that he would approve of face to  face meetings between the president of the United States and the president    and Ahmadinejad  He did not say that OBAMA: Of course not MCCAIN: He said that there could be secretary level and lower level meetings  I\\'ve always encouraged them  The Iranians have met with Ambassador Crocker in Baghdad w hat Senator Obama doesn\\'t seem to understand that if without precondition you sit down across the table from someone who has called Israel a \"stinking corpse \" and wants to destroy that country and wipe it off the map  you legitimize those comments This is dangerous  It isn\\'t just naive; it\\'s dangerous  And so we just have a fundamental difference of opinion As far as North Korea is concerned  our secretary of state  Madeleine Albright  went to North Korea  By the way  North Korea  most repressive and brutal regime probably on Earth  The average South Korean is three inches taller than the average North Korean  a huge gulag w e don\\'t know what the status of the dear leader\\'s health is today  but we know this  that the North Koreans have broken every agreement that they\\'ve entered into And we ought to go back to a little bit of Ronald Reagan\\'s \"trust  but verify \" and certainly not sit down across the table from    without precondition  as Senator Obama said he did twice  I mean  it\\'s just dangerous OBAMA: Look  I mean  Senator McCain keeps on using this example that suddenly the president would just meet with somebody without doing any preparation  without having low level talks  Nobody\\'s been talking about that  and Senator McCain knows it  This is a mischaracterization of my position w hen we talk about preconditions    and Henry Kissinger did say we should have contacts without preconditions    the idea is that we do not expect to solve every problem before we initiate talks And  you know  the Bush administration has come to recognize that it hasn\\'t worked  this notion that we are simply silent when it comes to our enemies  And the notion that we would sit with Ahmadinejad and not say anything while he\\'s spewing his nonsense and his vile comments is ridiculous  Nobody is even talking about that MCCAIN: So let me get this right  w e sit down with Ahmadinejad  and he says  \"w e\\'re going to wipe Israel off the face of the Earth \" and we say  \"No  you\\'re not\"  Oh  please OBAMA: No  let me tell   (CROSSTALK)MCCAIN: By the way  my friend  Dr  Kissinger  who\\'s been my friend for 35 years  would be interested to hear this conversation and Senator Obama\\'s depiction of his    of his positions on the issue  I\\'ve known him for 35 years OBAMA: w e will take a look MCCAIN: And I guarantee you he would not    he would not say that presidential top level OBAMA: Nobody\\'s talking about that MCCAIN: Of course he encourages and other people encourage contacts  and negotiations  and all other things  w e do that all the time LEHRER: w e\\'re going to go to a new   (CROSSTALK)MCCAIN: And Senator Obama is parsing words when he says precondition means preparation OBAMA: I am not parsing words MCCAIN: He\\'s parsing words  my friends OBAMA: I\\'m using the same words that your advisers use Please  go ahead LEHRER: New lead question Russia  goes to you  two minutes  Senator Obama  How do you see the relationship with Russia  Do you see them as a competitor  Do you see them as an enemy  Do you see them as a potential partner OBAMA: w ell  I think that  given what\\'s happened over the last several weeks and months  our entire Russian approach has to be evaluated  because a resurgent and very aggressive Russia is a threat to the peace and stability of the region Their actions in Georgia were unacceptable  They were unwarranted  And at this point  it is absolutely critical for the next president to make clear that we have to follow through on our six party    or the six point cease fire  They have to remove themselves from South Ossetia and Abkhazia It is absolutely important that we have a unified alliance and that we explain to the Russians that you cannot be a 21st century superpower  or power  and act like a 20th century dictatorship And we also have to affirm all the fledgling democracies in that region  you know  the Estonians  the Lithuanians  the Latvians  the Poles  the Czechs  that we are  in fact  going to be supportive and in solidarity with them in their efforts  They are members of NATO And to countries like Georgia and the Ukraine  I think we have to insist that they are free to join NATO if they meet the requirements  and they should have a membership action plan immediately to start bringing them in Now  we also can\\'t return to a Cold w ar posture with respect to Russia  It\\'s important that we recognize there are going to be some areas of common interest  One is nuclear proliferation They have not only 15 000 nuclear warheads  but they\\'ve got enough to make another 40 000  and some of those loose nukes could fall into the hands of Al Qaida This is an area where I\\'ve led on in the Senate  working with a Republican ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee  Dick Lugar  to deal with the proliferation of loose nuclear weapons  That\\'s an area where we\\'re going to have to work with Russia But we have to have a president who is clear that you don\\'t deal with Russia based on staring into his eyes and seeing his soul  You deal with Russia based on  what are your    what are the national security interests of the United States of America And we have to recognize that the way they\\'ve been behaving lately demands a sharp response from the international community and our allies LEHRER: Two minutes on Russia  Senator McCain MCCAIN: w ell  I was interested in Senator Obama\\'s reaction to the Russian aggression against Georgia  His first statement was  \"Both sides ought to show restraint \"Again  a little bit of naivete there  He doesn\\'t understand that Russia committed serious aggression against Georgia  And Russia has now become a nation fueled by petro dollars that is basically a KGB apparatchik run government I looked into Mr  Putin\\'s eyes  and I saw three letters  a \"K \" a \"G \" and a \"B \" And their aggression in Georgia is not acceptable behavior I don\\'t believe we\\'re going to go back to the Cold w ar  I am sure that that will not happen  But I do believe that we need to bolster our friends and allies  And that wasn\\'t just about a problem between Georgia and Russia  It had everything to do with energy There\\'s a pipeline that runs from the Caspian through Georgia through Turkey  And  of course  we know that the Russians control other sources of energy into Europe  which they have used from time to time It\\'s not accidental that the presidents of Latvia  Estonia  Lithuania  Poland  and Ukraine flew to Georgia  flew to Tbilisi  where I have spent significant amount of time with a great young president  Misha Saakashvili MCCAIN: And they showed solidarity with them  but  also  they are very concerned about the Russian threats to regain their status of the old Russian to regain their status of the old Russian empire Now  I think the Russians ought to understand that we will support    we  the United States    will support the inclusion of Georgia and Ukraine in the natural process  inclusion into NATO w e also ought to make it very clear that the Russians are in violation of their cease fire agreement  They have stationed additional troops in Abkhazia and South Ossetia By the way  I went there once  and we went inside and drove in  and there was a huge poster  And this is    this is Georgian territory  And there was a huge poster of Vladimir Putin  and it said  \"Vladimir Putin  our president \"It was very clear  the Russian intentions towards Georgia  They were just waiting to seize the opportunity So  this is a very difficult situation  w e want to work with the Russians  But we also have every right to expect the Russians to behave in a fashion and keeping with a    with a    with a country who respects international boundaries and the norms of international behavior And watch Ukraine  This whole thing has got a lot to do with Ukraine  Crimea  the base of the Russian fleet in Sevastopol  And the breakdown of the political process in Ukraine between Tymoshenko and Yushchenko is a very serious problem So watch Ukraine  and let\\'s make sure that we    that the Ukrainians understand that we are their friend and ally LEHRER: You see any    do you have a major difference with what he just said OBAMA: No  actually  I think Senator McCain and I agree for the most part on these issues  Obviously  I disagree with this notion that somehow we did not forcefully object to Russians going into Georgia I immediately said that this was illegal and objectionable  And  absolutely  I wanted a cessation of the violence  because it put an enormous strain on Georgia  and that\\'s why I was the first to say that we have to rebuild the Georgian economy and called for a billion dollars that has now gone in to help them rebuild Because part of Russia\\'s intentions here was to weaken the economy to the point where President Saakashvili was so weakened that he might be replaced by somebody that Putin favored more Two points I think are important to think about when it comes to Russia Number one is we have to have foresight and anticipate some of these problems  So back in April  I warned the administration that you had Russian peacekeepers in Georgian territory  That made no sense whatsoever And what we needed to do was replace them with international peacekeepers and a special envoy to resolve the crisis before it boiled over That wasn\\'t done  But had it been done  it\\'s possible we could have avoided the issue The second point I want to make is    is the issue of energy  Russia is in part resurgent and Putin is feeling powerful because of petro dollars  as Senator McCain mentioned That means that we  as one of the biggest consumers of oil    25 percent of the world\\'s oil    have to have an energy strategy not just to deal with Russia  but to deal with many of the rogue states we\\'ve talked about  Iran  Venezuela And that means  yes  increasing domestic production and off shore drilling  but we only have 3 percent of the world\\'s oil supplies and we use 25 percent of the world\\'s oil  So we can\\'t simply drill our way out of the problem w hat we\\'re going to have to do is to approach it through alternative energy  like solar  and wind  and biodiesel  and  yes  nuclear energy  clean coal technology  And  you know  I\\'ve got a plan for us to make a significant investment over the next 10 years to do that And I have to say  Senator McCain and I  I think agree on the importance of energy  but Senator McCain mentioned earlier the importance of looking at a record Over 26 years  Senator McCain voted 23 times against alternative energy  like solar  and wind  and biodiesel And so we    we    we\\'ve got to walk the walk and not just talk the talk when it comes to energy independence  because this is probably going to be just as vital for our economy and the pain that people are feeling at the pump    and  you know  winter\\'s coming and home heating oil    as it is our national security and the issue of climate change that\\'s so important LEHRER: w e\\'ve got time for one more lead question segment  w e\\'re way out of   (CROSSTALK)LEHRER: Quick response and then   (CROSSTALK)MCCAIN: No one from Arizona is against solar  And Senator Obama says he\\'s for nuclear  but he\\'s against reprocessing and he\\'s against storing  So   OBAMA: That\\'s just not true  John  John  I\\'m sorry  but that\\'s not true MCCAIN:     it\\'s hard to get there from here  And off shore drilling is also something that is very important and it is a bridge And we know that  if we drill off shore and exploit a lot of these reserves  it will help  at temporarily  relieve our energy requirements  And it will have  I think  an important effect on the price of a barrel of oil OBAMA: I just have to respond very quickly  just to correct    just to correct the record MCCAIN: So I want to say that  with the Nunn Lugar thing   LEHRER: Excuse me  Senator OBAMA: John MCCAIN:     I supported Nunn Lugar back in the early 1990s when a lot of my colleagues didn\\'t  That was the key legislation at the time and put us on the road to eliminating this issue of nuclear waste and the nuclear fuel that has to be taken care of OBAMA: I    I just have to correct the record here  I have never said that I object to nuclear waste  w hat I\\'ve said is that we have to store it safely And  Senator McCain  he says    he talks about Arizona LEHRER: All right OBAMA: I\\'ve got to make this point  Jim LEHRER: OK OBAMA: He objects   MCCAIN: I have voted for alternate fuel all of my time   OBAMA: He    he    he objects   (CROSSTALK)LEHRER: One at a time  please OBAMA: He objected   LEHRER: One at a time MCCAIN: No one can be opposed to alternate energy OBAMA: All right  fair enough  Let\\'s move on  You\\'ve got one more energy    you\\'ve got one more question LEHRER: This is the last    last lead question  You have two minutes each  And the question is this  beginning with you  Senator McCain w hat do you think the likelihood is that there would be another 9/11 type attack on the continental United States MCCAIN: I think it\\'s much less than it was the day after 9/11  I think it    that we have a safer nation  but we are a long way from safe And I want to tell you that one of the things I\\'m most proud of  among others  because I have worked across the aisle  I have a long record on that  on a long series of reforms But after 9/11  Senator Joe Lieberman and I decided that we needed a commission  and that was a commission to investigate 9/11  and find out what happened  and fix it And we were    we were opposed by the administration  another area where I differed with this administration  And we were stymied until the families of 9/11 came  and they descended on w ashington  and we got that legislation passed And there were a series of recommendations  as I recall  more than 40  And I\\'m happy to say that we\\'ve gotten written into law most of those reforms recommended by that commission  I\\'m proud of that work  again  bipartisan  reaching across the aisle  working together  Democrat and Republican alike So we have a long way to go in our intelligence services  w e have to do a better job in human intelligence  And we\\'ve got to    to make sure that we have people who are trained interrogators so that we don\\'t ever torture a prisoner ever again w e have to make sure that our technological and intelligence capabilities are better  w e have to work more closely with our allies  I know our allies  and I can work much more closely with them But I can tell you that I think America is safer today than it was on 9/11  But that doesn\\'t mean that we don\\'t have a long way to go And I\\'d like to remind you  also  as a result of those recommendations  we\\'ve probably had the largest reorganization of government since we established the Defense Department  And I think that those men and women in those agencies are doing a great job But we still have a long way to go before we can declare America safe  and that means doing a better job along our borders  as well LEHRER: Two minutes  Senator Obama OBAMA: w ell  first of all  I think that we are safer in some ways  Obviously  we\\'ve poured billions of dollars into airport security  w e have done some work in terms of securing potential targets  but we still have a long way to go w e\\'ve got to make sure that we\\'re hardening our chemical sites  w e haven\\'t done enough in terms of transit; we haven\\'t done enough in terms of ports And the biggest threat that we face right now is not a nuclear missile coming over the skies  It\\'s in a suitcase This is why the issue of nuclear proliferation is so important  It is the    the biggest threat to the United States is a terrorist getting their hands on nuclear weapons And we    we are spending billions of dollars on missile defense  And I actually believe that we need missile defense  because of Iran and North Korea and the potential for them to obtain or to launch nuclear weapons  but I also believe that  when we are only spending a few hundred million dollars on nuclear proliferation  then we\\'re making a mistake The other thing that we have to focus on  though  is Al Qaida  They are now operating in 60 countries  w e can\\'t simply be focused on Iraq  w e have to go to the root cause  and that is in Afghanistan and Pakistan  That\\'s going to be critical  w e are going to need more cooperation with our allies And one last point I want to make  It is important for us to understand that the way we are perceived in the world is going to make a difference  in terms of our capacity to get cooperation and root out terrorism And one of the things that I intend to do as president is to restore America\\'s standing in the world  w e are less respected now than we were eight years ago or even four years ago OBAMA: And this is the greatest country on Earth  But because of some of the mistakes that have been made    and I give Senator McCain great credit on the torture issue  for having identified that as something that undermines our long term security    because of those things  we  I think  are going to have a lot of work to do in the next administration to restore that sense that America is that shining beacon on a hill LEHRER: Do you agree there\\'s much to be done in a new administration to restore   (CROSSTALK)MCCAIN: But in the case of missile defense  Senator Obama said it had to be  quote  \"proven \" That wasn\\'t proven when Ronald Reagan said we would do SDI  which is missile defense  And it was major    a major factor in bringing about the end of the Cold w ar w e seem to come full circle again  Senator Obama still doesn\\'t quite understand    or doesn\\'t get it    that if we fail in Iraq  it encourages Al Qaida  They would establish a base in Iraq The consequences of defeat  which would result from his plan of withdrawal and according to date certain  regardless of conditions  according to our military leaders  according to every expert  would lead to defeat    possible defeat  loss of all the fragile sacrifice that we\\'ve made of American blood and treasure  which grieves us all All of that would be lost if we followed Senator Obama\\'s plan to have specific dates with withdrawal  regardless of conditions on the ground And General Petraeus says we have had great success  but it\\'s very fragile  And we can\\'t do what Senator Obama wants to do That is the central issue of our time  And I think Americans will judge very seriously as to whether that\\'s the right path or the wrong path and who should be the next president of the United States LEHRER: You see the same connections that Senator McCain does OBAMA: Oh  there\\'s no doubt  Look  over the last eight years  this administration  along with Senator McCain  have been solely focused on Iraq  That has been their priority  That has been where all our resources have gone In the meantime  bin Laden is still out there  He is not captured  He is not killed  Al Qaida is resurgent In the meantime  we\\'ve got challenges  for example  with China  where we are borrowing billions of dollars  They now hold a trillion dollars\\' worth of our debt  And they are active in countries like    in regions like Latin America  and Asia  and Africa  They are    the conspicuousness of their presence is only matched by our absence  because we\\'ve been focused on Iraq w e have weakened our capacity to project power around the world because we have viewed everything through this single lens  not to mention  look at our economy  w e are now spending $10 billion or more every month And that means we can\\'t provide health care to people who need it  w e can\\'t invest in science and technology  which will determine whether or not we are going to be competitive in the long term There has never been a country on Earth that saw its economy decline and yet maintained its military superiority  So this is a national security issue w e haven\\'t adequately funded veterans\\' care  I sit on the Veterans Affairs Committee  and we\\'ve got    I meet veterans all across the country who are trying to figure out  \"How can I get disability payments  I\\'ve got post traumatic stress disorder  and yet I can\\'t get treatment \"So we have put all chips in  right there  and nobody is talking about losing this war  w hat we are talking about is recognizing that the next president has to have a broader strategic vision about all the challenges that we face That\\'s been missing over the last eight years  That sense is something that I want to restore MCCAIN: I\\'ve been involved  as I mentioned to you before  in virtually every major national security challenge we\\'ve faced in the last 20 some years  There are some advantages to experience  and knowledge  and judgment And I    and I honestly don\\'t believe that Senator Obama has the knowledge or experience and has made the wrong judgments in a number of areas  including his initial reaction to Russian invasion    aggression in Georgia  to his    you know  we\\'ve seen this stubbornness before in this administration to cling to a belief that somehow the surge has not succeeded and failing to acknowledge that he was wrong about the surge is    shows to me that we    that    that we need more flexibility in a president of the United States than that As far as our other issues that he brought up are concerned  I know the veterans  I know them well  And I know that they know that I\\'ll take care of them  And I\\'ve been proud of their support and their recognition of my service to the veterans And I love them  And I\\'ll take care of them  And they know that I\\'ll take care of them  And that\\'s going to be my job But  also  I have the ability  and the knowledge  and the background to make the right judgments  to keep this country safe and secure Reform  prosperity  and peace  these are major challenges to the United States of America  I don\\'t think I need any on the job training  I\\'m ready to go at it right now OBAMA: w ell  let me just make a closing point  You know  my father came from Kenya  That\\'s where I get my name And in the \\'60s  he wrote letter after letter to come to college here in the United States because the notion was that there was no other country on Earth where you could make it if you tried  The ideals and the values of the United States inspired the entire world I don\\'t think any of us can say that our standing in the world now  the way children around the world look at the United States  is the same And part of what we need to do  what the next president has to do    and this is part of our judgment  this is part of how we\\'re going to keep America safe    is to    to send a message to the world that we are going to invest in issues like education  we are going to invest in issues that    that relate to how ordinary people are able to live out their dreams And that is something that I\\'m going to be committed to as president of the United States LEHRER: Few seconds  w e\\'re almost finished MCCAIN: Jim  when I came home from prison  I saw our veterans being very badly treated  and it made me sad  And I embarked on an effort to resolve the POw  MIA issue  which we did in a bipartisan fashion  and then I worked on normalization of relations between our two countries so that our veterans could come all the way home I guarantee you  as president of the United States  I know how to heal the wounds of war  I know how to deal with our adversaries  and I know how to deal with our friends LEHRER: And that ends this debate tonight On October 2nd  next Thursday  also at

PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEEJIM LEHREREXECUTIVE EDITOR AND ANCHOR  THE NEw SHOUR  PBS[*] LEHRER: Good evening from the Ford Center for the Performing Arts at the University of Mississippi in Oxford  I\\'m Jim Lehrer of the NewsHour on PBS  and I welcome you to the first of the 2008 presidential debates between the Republican nominee  Senator John McCain of Arizona  and the Democratic nominee  Senator Barack Obama of Illinois The Commission on Presidential Debates is the sponsor of this event and the three other presidential and vice presidential debates coming in October Tonight\\'s will primarily be about foreign policy and national security  which  by definition  includes the global financial crisis  It will be divided roughly into nine minute segments Direct exchanges between the candidates and moderator follow ups are permitted after each candidate has two minutes to answer the lead question in an order determined by a coin toss The specific subjects and questions were chosen by me  They have not been shared or cleared with anyone The audience here in the hall has promised to remain silent  no cheers  no applause  no noise of any kind  except right now  as we welcome Senators Obama and McCain (APPLAUSE)Let me begin with something General Eisenhower said in his 1952 presidential campaign  Quote  \"w e must achieve both security and solvency  In fact  the foundation of military strength is economic strength \" end quote w ith that in mind  the first lead question Gentlemen  at this very moment tonight  where do you stand on the financial recovery plan First response to you  Senator Obama  You have two minutes OBAMA: w ell  thank you very much  Jim  and thanks to the commission and the University of Mississippi  Ole Miss  for hosting us tonight  I can\\'t think of a more important time for us to talk about the future of the country You know  we are at a defining moment in our history  Our nation is involved in two wars  and we are going through the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression And although we\\'ve heard a lot about w all Street  those of you on Main Street I think have been struggling for a while  and you recognize that this could have an impact on all sectors of the economy And you\\'re wondering  how\\'s it going to affect me  How\\'s it going to affect my job  How\\'s it going to affect my house  How\\'s it going to affect my retirement savings or my ability to send my children to college So we have to move swiftly  and we have to move wisely  And I\\'ve put forward a series of proposals that make sure that we protect taxpayers as we engage in this important rescue effort Number one  we\\'ve got to make sure that we\\'ve got oversight over this whole process; $700 billion  potentially  is a lot of money Number two  we\\'ve got to make sure that taxpayers  when they are putting their money at risk  have the possibility of getting that money back and gains  if the market    and when the market returns Number three  we\\'ve got to make sure that none of that money is going to pad CEO bank accounts or to promote golden parachutes And  number four  we\\'ve got to make sure that we\\'re helping homeowners  because the root problem here has to do with the foreclosures that are taking place all across the country Now  we also have to recognize that this is a final verdict on eight years of failed economic policies promoted by George Bush  supported by Senator McCain  a theory that basically says that we can shred regulations and consumer protections and give more and more to the most  and somehow prosperity will trickle down It hasn\\'t worked  And I think that the fundamentals of the economy have to be measured by whether or not the middle class is getting a fair shake  That\\'s why I\\'m running for president  and that\\'s what I hope we\\'re going to be talking about tonight LEHRER: Senator McCain  two minutes MCCAIN: w ell  thank you  Jim  And thanks to everybody And I do have a sad note tonight  Senator Kennedy is in the hospital  He\\'s a dear and beloved friend to all of us  Our thoughts and prayers go out to the lion of the Senate I also want to thank the University of Mississippi for hosting us tonight And  Jim  I    I\\'ve been not feeling too great about a lot of things lately  So have a lot of Americans who are facing challenges  But I\\'m feeling a little better tonight  and I\\'ll tell you why Because as we\\'re here tonight in this debate  we are seeing  for the first time in a long time  Republicans and Democrats together  sitting down  trying to work out a solution to this fiscal crisis that we\\'re in And have no doubt about the magnitude of this crisis  And we\\'re not talking about failure of institutions on w all Street  w e\\'re talking about failures on Main Street  and people who will lose their jobs  and their credits  and their homes  if we don\\'t fix the greatest fiscal crisis  probably in    certainly in our time  and I\\'ve been around a little while But the point is    the point is  we have finally seen Republicans and Democrats sitting down and negotiating together and coming up with a package This package has transparency in it  It has to have accountability and oversight  It has to have options for loans to failing businesses  rather than the government taking over those loans  w e have to    it has to have a package with a number of other essential elements to it And  yes  I went back to w ashington  and I met with my Republicans in the House of Representatives  And they weren\\'t part of the negotiations  and I understand that  And it was the House Republicans that decided that they would be part of the solution to this problem But I want to emphasize one point to all Americans tonight  This isn\\'t the beginning of the end of this crisis  This is the end of the beginning  if we come out with a package that will keep these institutions stable And we\\'ve got a lot of work to do  And we\\'ve got to create jobs  And one of the areas  of course  is to eliminate our dependence on foreign oil LEHRER: All right  let\\'s go back to my question  How do you all stand on the recovery plan  And talk to each other about it  w e\\'ve got five minutes  w e can negotiate a deal right here But  I mean  are you    do you favor this plan  Senator Obama  and you  Senator McCain  Do you    are you in favor of this plan OBAMA: w e haven\\'t seen the language yet  And I do think that there\\'s constructive work being done out there  So  for the viewers who are watching  I am optimistic about the capacity of us to come together with a plan The question  I think  that we have to ask ourselves is  how did we get into this situation in the first place Two years ago  I warned that  because of the subprime lending mess  because of the lax regulation  that we were potentially going to have a problem and tried to stop some of the abuses in mortgages that were taking place at the time Last year  I wrote to the secretary of the Treasury to make sure that he understood the magnitude of this problem and to call on him to bring all the stakeholders together to try to deal with it So    so the question  I think  that we\\'ve got to ask ourselves is  yes  we\\'ve got to solve this problem short term  And we are going to have to intervene; there\\'s no doubt about that But we\\'re also going to have to look at  how is it that we shredded so many regulations  w e did not set up a 21st century regulatory framework to deal with these problems  And that in part has to do with an economic philosophy that says that regulation is always bad LEHRER: Are you going to vote for the plan  Senator McCain MCCAIN: I    I hope so  And I   LEHRER: As a United States senator   MCCAIN: Sure LEHRER:     you\\'re going to vote for the plan MCCAIN: Sure  But    but let me    let me point out  I also warned about Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and warned about corporate greed and excess  and CEO pay  and all that  A lot of us saw this train wreck coming But there\\'s also the issue of responsibility  You\\'ve mentioned President Dwight David Eisenhower  President Eisenhower  on the night before the Normandy invasion  went into his room  and he wrote out two letters One of them was a letter congratulating the great members of the military and allies that had conducted and succeeded in the greatest invasion in history  still to this day  and forever And he wrote out another letter  and that was a letter of resignation from the United States Army for the failure of the landings at Normandy Somehow we\\'ve lost that accountability  I\\'ve been heavily criticized because I called for the resignation of the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission  w e\\'ve got to start also holding people accountable  and we\\'ve got to reward people who succeed But somehow in w ashington today    and I\\'m afraid on w all Street    greed is rewarded  excess is rewarded  and corruption    or certainly failure to carry out our responsibility is rewarded As president of the United States  people are going to be held accountable in my administration  And I promise you that that will happen LEHRER: Do you have something directly to say  Senator Obama  to Senator McCain about what he just said OBAMA: w ell  I think Senator McCain\\'s absolutely right that we need more responsibility  but we need it not just when there\\'s a crisis  I mean  we\\'ve had years in which the reigning economic ideology has been what\\'s good for w all Street  but not what\\'s good for Main Street And there are folks out there who\\'ve been struggling before this crisis took place  And that\\'s why it\\'s so important  as we solve this short term problem  that we look at some of the underlying issues that have led to wages and incomes for ordinary Americans to go down  the    a health care system that is broken  energy policies that are not working  because  you know  10 days ago  John said that the fundamentals of the economy are sound LEHRER: Say it directly to him OBAMA: I do not think that they are LEHRER: Say it directly to him OBAMA: w ell  the    John  10 days ago  you said that the fundamentals of the economy are sound  And   MCCAIN: Are you afraid I couldn\\'t hear him (LAUGHTER)LEHRER: I\\'m just determined to get you all to talk to each other  I\\'m going to try OBAMA: The    and I just fundamentally disagree  And unless we are holding ourselves accountable day in  day out  not just when there\\'s a crisis for folks who have power and influence and can hire lobbyists  but for the nurse  the teacher  the police officer  who  frankly  at the end of each month  they\\'ve got a little financial crisis going on They\\'re having to take out extra debt just to make their mortgage payments  w e haven\\'t been paying attention to them  And if you look at our tax policies  it\\'s a classic example LEHRER: So  Senator McCain  do you agree with what Senator Obama just said  And  if you don\\'t  tell him what you disagree with MCCAIN: No  I    look  we\\'ve got to fix the system  w e\\'ve got fundamental problems in the system  And Main Street is paying a penalty for the excesses and greed in w ashington  D C   and in the w all Street So there\\'s no doubt that we have a long way to go  And  obviously  stricter interpretation and consolidation of the various regulatory agencies that weren\\'t doing their job  that has brought on this crisis But I have a fundamental belief in the goodness and strength of the American worker  And the American worker is the most productive  the most innovative  America is still the greatest producer  exporter and importer But we\\'ve got to get through these times  but I have a fundamental belief in the United States of America  And I still believe  under the right leadership  our best days are ahead of us LEHRER: All right  let\\'s go to the next lead question  which is essentially following up on this same subject And you get two minutes to begin with  Senator McCain  And using your word \"fundamental \" are there fundamental differences between your approach and Senator Obama\\'s approach to what you would do as president to lead this country out of the financial crisis MCCAIN: w ell  the first thing we have to do is get spending under control in w ashington  It\\'s completely out of control  It\\'s gone    we have now presided over the largest increase in the size of government since the Great Society w e Republicans came to power to change government  and government changed us  And the    the worst symptom on this disease is what my friend  Tom Coburn  calls earmarking as a gateway drug  because it\\'s a gateway  It\\'s a gateway to out of control spending and corruption And we have former members of Congress now residing in federal prison because of the evils of this earmarking and pork barrel spending You know  we spent $3 million to study the DNA of bears in Montana  I don\\'t know if that was a criminal issue or a paternal issue  but the fact is that it was $3 million of our taxpayers\\' money  And it has got to be brought under control As president of the United States  I want to assure you  I\\'ve got a pen  This one\\'s kind of old  I\\'ve got a pen  and I\\'m going to veto every single spending bill that comes across my desk  I will make them famous  You will know their names Now  Senator Obama  you wanted to know one of the differences  He has asked for $932 million of earmark pork barrel spending  nearly a million dollars for every day that he\\'s been in the United States Senate I suggest that people go up on the w eb site of Citizens Against Government w aste  and they\\'ll look at those projects That kind of thing is not the way to rein in runaway spending in w ashington  D C  That\\'s one of the fundamental differences that Senator Obama and I have LEHRER: Senator Obama  two minutes OBAMA: w ell  Senator McCain is absolutely right that the earmarks process has been abused  which is why I suspended any requests for my home state  whether it was for senior centers or what have you  until we cleaned it up And he\\'s also right that oftentimes lobbyists and special interests are the ones that are introducing these kinds of requests  although that wasn\\'t the case with me But let\\'s be clear: Earmarks account for $18 billion in last year\\'s budget  Senator McCain is proposing    and this is a fundamental difference between us    $300 billion in tax cuts to some of the wealthiest corporations and individuals in the country  $300 billion Now  $18 billion is important; $300 billion is really important  And in his tax plan  you would have CEOs of Fortune 500 companies getting an average of $700 000 in reduced taxes  while leaving 100 million Americans out So my attitude is  we\\'ve got to grow the economy from the bottom up  w hat I\\'ve called for is a tax cut for 95 percent of working families  95 percent And that means that the ordinary American out there who\\'s collecting a paycheck every day  they\\'ve got a little extra money to be able to buy a computer for their kid  to fill up on this gas that is killing them And over time  that  I think  is going to be a better recipe for economic growth than the    the policies of President Bush that John McCain wants to    wants to follow LEHRER: Senator McCain MCCAIN: w ell  again  I don\\'t mean to go back and forth  but he   (CROSSTALK)LEHRER: No  that\\'s fine MCCAIN: Senator Obama suspended those requests for pork barrel projects after he was running for president of the United States  He didn\\'t happen to see that light during the first three years as a member of the United States Senate  $932 million in requests Maybe to Senator Obama it\\'s not a lot of money  But the point is that    you see  I hear this all the time  \"It\\'s only $18 billion \" Do you know that it\\'s tripled in the last five years  Do you know that it\\'s gone completely out of control to the point where it corrupts people  It corrupts people That\\'s why we have  as I said  people under federal indictment and charges  It\\'s a system that\\'s got to be cleaned up I have fought against it my career  I have fought against it  I was called the sheriff  by the    one of the senior members of the Appropriations Committee  I didn\\'t win Miss Congeniality in the United States Senate Now  Senator Obama didn\\'t mention that  along with his tax cuts  he is also proposing some $800 billion in new spending on new programs Now  that\\'s a fundamental difference between myself and Senator Obama  I want to cut spending  I want to keep taxes low  The worst thing we could do in this economic climate is to raise people\\'s taxes OBAMA: I    I don\\'t know where John is getting his figures  Let\\'s just be clear w hat I do is I close corporate loopholes  stop providing tax cuts to corporations that are shipping jobs overseas so that we\\'re giving tax breaks to companies that are investing here in the United States  I make sure that we have a health care system that allows for everyone to have basic coverage I think those are pretty important priorities  And I pay for every dime of it But let\\'s go back to the original point  John  nobody is denying that $18 billion is important  And  absolutely  we need earmark reform  And when I\\'m president  I will go line by line to make sure that we are not spending money unwisely But the fact is that eliminating earmarks alone is not a recipe for how we\\'re going to get the middle class back on track OBAMA: And when you look at your tax policies that are directed primarily at those who are doing well  and you are neglecting people who are really struggling right now  I think that is a continuation of the last eight years  and we can\\'t afford another four LEHRER: Respond directly to him about that  to Senator Obama about that  about the    he\\'s made it twice now  about your tax    your policies about tax cuts MCCAIN: w ell    well  let me give you an example of what Senator Obama finds objectionable  the business tax Right now  in the United States of America  business pays the second highest business taxes in the world  35 percent  Ireland pays 11 percent Now  if you\\'re a business person  and you can locate any place in the world  then  obviously  if you go to the country where it\\'s 11 percent tax versus 35 percent  you\\'re going to be able to create jobs  increase your business  make more investment  et cetera I want to cut that business tax  I want to cut it so that businesses will remain in    in the United States of America and create jobs But  again  I want to return  It\\'s a lot more than $18 billion in pork barrel spending  I can tell you  it\\'s rife  It\\'s throughout The United States Senate will take up a continuing resolution tomorrow or the next day  sometime next week  with 2 000    2 000    look at them  my friends  Look at them  You\\'ll be appalled And Senator Obama is a recent convert  after requesting $932 million worth of pork barrel spending projects So the point is  I want people to have tax cuts  I want every family to have a $5 000 refundable tax credit so they can go out and purchase their own health care  I want to double the dividend from $3 500 to $7 000 for every dependent child in America I know that the worst thing we could possibly do is to raise taxes on anybody  and a lot of people might be interested in Senator Obama\\'s definition of \"rich \"LEHRER: Senator Obama  you have a question for Senator McCain on that OBAMA: w ell  let me just make a couple of points LEHRER: All right OBAMA: My definition    here\\'s what I can tell the American people: 95 percent of you will get a tax cut  And if you make less than $250 000  less than a quarter million dollars a year  then you will not see one dime\\'s worth of tax increase Now  John mentioned the fact that business taxes on paper are high in this country  and he\\'s absolutely right  Here\\'s the problem: There are so many loopholes that have been written into the tax code  oftentimes with support of Senator McCain  that we actually see our businesses pay effectively one of the lowest tax rates in the world And what that means  then  is that there are people out there who are working every day  who are not getting a tax cut  and you want to give them more It\\'s not like you want to close the loopholes  You just want to add an additional tax cut over the loopholes  And that\\'s a problem Just one last point I want to make  since Senator McCain talked about providing a $5 000 health credit  Now  what he doesn\\'t tell you is that he intends to  for the first time in history  tax health benefits So you may end up getting a $5 000 tax credit  Here\\'s the only problem: Your employer now has to pay taxes on the health care that you\\'re getting from your employer  And if you end up losing your health care from your employer  you\\'ve got to go out on the open market and try to buy it It is not a good deal for the American people  But it\\'s an example of this notion that the market can always solve everything and that the less regulation we have  the better off we\\'re going to be MCCAIN: w ell  you know  let me just   LEHRER: w e\\'ve got to go to another lead question MCCAIN: I know we have to  but this is a classic example of walking the walk and talking the talk w e had an energy bill before the United States Senate  It was festooned with Christmas tree ornaments  It had all kinds of breaks for the oil companies  I mean  billions of dollars worth  I voted against it; Senator Obama voted for it OBAMA: John  you want to give oil companies another $4 billion MCCAIN: You\\'ve got to look at our record  You\\'ve got to look at our records  That\\'s the important thing w ho fought against wasteful and earmark spending  w ho has been the person who has tried to keep spending under control w ho\\'s the person who has believed that the best thing for America is    is to have a tax system that is fundamentally fair  And I\\'ve fought to simplify it  and I have proposals to simplify it Let\\'s give every American a choice: two tax brackets  generous dividends  and  two    and let Americans choose whether they want the    the existing tax code or they want a new tax code And so  again  look at the record  particularly the energy bill  But  again  Senator Obama has shifted on a number of occasions  He has voted in the United States Senate to increase taxes on people who make as low as $42 000 a year OBAMA: That\\'s not true  John  That\\'s not true MCCAIN: And that\\'s just a fact  Again  you can look it up OBAMA: Look  it\\'s just not true  And if we want to talk about oil company profits  under your tax plan  John    this is undeniable    oil companies would get an additional $4 billion in tax breaks Now  look  we all would love to lower taxes on everybody  But here\\'s the problem: If we are giving them to oil companies  then that means that there are those who are not going to be getting them  And   MCCAIN: w ith all due respect  you already gave them to the oil companies OBAMA: No  but  John  the fact of the matter is  is that I was opposed to those tax breaks  tried to strip them out  w e\\'ve got an energy bill on the Senate floor right now that contains some good stuff  some stuff you want  including drilling off shore  but you\\'re opposed to it because it would strip away those tax breaks that have gone to oil companies LEHRER: All right  All right  speaking of things that both of you want  another lead question  and it has to do with the rescue    the financial rescue thing that we started    started asking about And what    and the first answer is to you  Senator Obama  As president  as a result of whatever financial rescue plan comes about and the billion  $700 billion  whatever it is it\\'s going to cost  what are you going to have to give up  in terms of the priorities that you would bring as president of the United States  as a result of having to pay for the financial rescue plan OBAMA: w ell  there are a range of things that are probably going to have to be delayed  w e don\\'t yet know what our tax revenues are going to be  The economy is slowing down  so it\\'s hard to anticipate right now what the budget is going to look like next year But there\\'s no doubt that we\\'re not going to be able to do everything that I think needs to be done  There are some things that I think have to be done w e have to have energy independence  so I\\'ve put forward a plan to make sure that  in 10 years\\' time  we have freed ourselves from dependence on Middle Eastern oil by increasing production at home  but most importantly by starting to invest in alternative energy  solar  wind  biodiesel  making sure that we\\'re developing the fuel efficient cars of the future right here in the United States  in Ohio and Michigan  instead of Japan and South Korea w e have to fix our health care system  which is putting an enormous burden on families  Just    a report just came out that the average deductible went up 30 percent on American families They are getting crushed  and many of them are going bankrupt as a consequence of health care  I\\'m meeting folks all over the country  w e have to do that now  because it will actually make our businesses and our families better off The third thing we have to do is we\\'ve got to make sure that we\\'re competing in education  w e\\'ve got to invest in science and technology  China had a space launch and a space walk  w e\\'ve got to make sure that our children are keeping pace in math and in science And one of the things I think we have to do is make sure that college is affordable for every young person in America And I also think that we\\'re going to have to rebuild our infrastructure  which is falling behind  our roads  our bridges  but also broadband lines that reach into rural communities Also  making sure that we have a new electricity grid to get the alternative energy to population centers that are using them So there are some    some things that we\\'ve got to do structurally to make sure that we can compete in this global economy  w e can\\'t shortchange those things  w e\\'ve got to eliminate programs that don\\'t work  and we\\'ve got to make sure that the programs that we do have are more efficient and cost less LEHRER: Are you    what priorities would you adjust  as president  Senator McCain  because of the    because of the financial bailout cost MCCAIN: Look  we  no matter what  we\\'ve got to cut spending  w e have    as I said  we\\'ve let government get completely out of control Senator Obama has the most liberal voting record in the United States Senate  It\\'s hard to reach across the aisle from that far to the left The point    the point is    the point is  we need to examine every agency of government First of all  by the way  I\\'d eliminate ethanol subsidies  I oppose ethanol subsidies I think that we have to return    particularly in defense spending  which is the largest part of our appropriations    we have to do away with cost plus contracts  w e now have defense systems that the costs are completely out of control w e tried to build a little ship called the Littoral Combat Ship that was supposed to cost $140 million  ended up costing $400 million  and we still haven\\'t done it So we need to have fixed cost contracts  w e need very badly to understand that defense spending is very important and vital  particularly in the new challenges we face in the world  but we have to get a lot of the cost overruns under control I know how to do that MCCAIN: I saved the taxpayers $6 8 billion by fighting a contract that was negotiated between Boeing and DOD that was completely wrong  And we fixed it and we killed it and the people ended up in federal prison so I know how to do this because I\\'ve been involved these issues for many  many years  But I think that we have to examine every agency of government and find out those that are doing their job and keep them and find out those that aren\\'t and eliminate them and we\\'ll have to scrub every agency of government LEHRER: But if I hear the two of you correctly neither one of you is suggesting any major changes in what you want to do as president as a result of the financial bailout  Is that what you\\'re saying OBAMA: No  As I said before  Jim  there are going to be things that end up having to be    LEHRER: Like what OBAMA:     deferred and delayed  w ell  look  I want to make sure that we are investing in energy in order to free ourselves from the dependence on foreign oil  That is a big project  That is a multi year project LEHRER: Not willing to give that up OBAMA: Not willing to give up the need to do it but there may be individual components that we can\\'t do  But John is right we have to make cuts  w e right now give $15 billion every year as subsidies to private insurers under the Medicare system  Doesn\\'t work any better through the private insurers  They just skim off $15 billion  That was a give away and part of the reason is because lobbyists are able to shape how Medicare works They did it on the Medicaid prescription drug bill and we have to change the culture  Tom    or John mentioned me being wildly liberal  Mostly that\\'s just me opposing George Bush\\'s wrong headed policies since I\\'ve been in Congress but I think it is that it is also important to recognize I worked with Tom Coburn  the most conservative  one of the most conservative Republicans who John already mentioned to set up what we call a Google for government saying we\\'ll list every dollar of federal spending to make sure that the taxpayer can take a look and see who  in fact  is promoting some of these spending projects that John\\'s been railing about LEHRER: w hat I\\'m trying to get at this is this  Excuse me if I may  senator  Trying to get at that you all    one of you is going to be the president of the United States come January  At the    in the middle of a huge financial crisis that is yet to be resolved  And what I\\'m trying to get at is how this is going to affect you not in very specific    small ways but in major ways and the approach to take as to the presidency MCCAIN: How about a spending freeze on everything but defense  veteran affairs and entitlement programs LEHRER: Spending freeze MCCAIN: I think we ought to seriously consider with the exceptions of caring for our veterans national defense and several other vital issues LEHRER: w ould you go for that OBAMA: The problem with a spending freeze is you\\'re using a hatchet where you need a scalpel  There are some programs that are very important that are under funded  I went to increase early childhood education and the notion that we should freeze that when there may be  for example  this Medicare subsidy  I think  doesn\\'t make sense Let me tell you another place to look for some savings  w e are currently spending $10 billion a month in Iraq when they have a $79 billion surplus  It seems to me that if we\\'re going to be strong at home as well as strong abroad  that we have to look at bringing that war to a close MCCAIN: Look  we are sending $700 billion a year overseas to countries that don\\'t like us very much  Some of that money ends up in the hands of terrorist organizations  w e have to have wind  tide  solar  natural gas  flex fuel cars and all that but we also have to have offshore drilling and we also have to have nuclear power Senator Obama opposes both storing and reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel  You can\\'t get there from here and the fact is that we can create 700 000 jobs by building constructing 45 new nuclear power plants by the year 2030  Nuclear power is not only important as far as eliminating our dependence on foreign oil but it\\'s also responsibility as far as climate change is concerned  An issue I have been involved in for many  many years and I\\'m proud of the work of the work that I\\'ve done there along with Senator Clinton LEHRER: Before we go to another lead question  Let me figure out a way to ask the same question in a slightly different way here  Are you    are you willing to acknowledge both of you that this financial crisis is going to affect the way you rule the country as president of the United States beyond the kinds of things that you have already    I mean  is it a major move  Is it going to have a major affect OBAMA: There\\'s no doubt itâ€™s gonna affect our budgets  There is no doubt about it  Not only    Even if we get all $700 billion back  let\\'s assume the markets recover  we\\'re holding assets long enough that eventually taxpayers get it back and that happened during the Great Depression when Roosevelt purchased a whole bunch of homes  over time  home values went back up and in fact government made a profit  If we\\'re lucky and we do it right  that could potentially happen but in the short term there\\'s an outlay and we may not see that money for a while And because of the economy\\'s slowing down  I think we can also expect less tax revenue so there\\'s no doubt that as president I\\'m going to have to make some tough decision The only point I want to make is this  that in order to make those tough decisions we have to know what our values are and who we\\'re fighting for and what our priorities are and if we are spending $300 billion on tax cuts for people who don\\'t need them and weren\\'t even asking for them  and we are leaving out health care which is crushing on people all across the country  then I think we have made a bad decision and I want to make sure we\\'re not shortchanging our long term priorities MCCAIN: w ell  I want to make sure we\\'re not handing the health care system over to the federal government which is basically what would ultimately happen with Senator Obama\\'s health care plan  I want the families to make decisions between themselves and their doctors  Not the federal government  Look  w e have to obviously cut spending  I have fought to cut spending  Senator Obama has $800 billion in new spending programs  I would suggest he start by canceling some of those new spending program that he has w e can\\'t I think adjust spending around to take care of the very much needed programs  including taking care of our veterans but I also want to say again a healthy economy with low taxes would not raising anyone\\'s taxes is probably the best recipe for eventually having our economy recover And spending restraint has got to be a vital part of that  And the reason  one of the major reasons why we\\'re in the difficulties we are in today is because spending got out of control  w e owe China $500 billion  And spending  I know  can be brought under control because I have fought against excessive spending my entire career  And I got plans to reduce and eliminate unnecessary and wasteful spending and if there\\'s anybody here who thinks there aren\\'t agencies of government where spending can be cut and their budgets slashed they have not spent a lot of time in w ashington OBAMA: I just want to make this point  Jim  John  it\\'s been your president who you said you agreed with 90 percent of the time who presided over this increase in spending  This orgy of spending and enormous deficits you voted for almost all of his budgets  So to stand here and after eight years and say that you\\'re going to lead on controlling spending and  you know  balancing our tax cuts so that they help middle class families when over the last eight years that hasn\\'t happened I think just is  you know  kind of hard to swallow LEHRER: Quick response to Senator Obama MCCAIN: It\\'s well known that I have not been elected Miss Congeniality in the United States Senate nor with the administration  I have opposed the president on spending  on climate change  on torture of prisoner  on   on Guantanamo Bay  On a    on the way that the Iraq w ar was conducted  I have a long record and the American people know me very well and that is independent and a maverick of the Senate and I\\'m happy to say that I\\'ve got a partner that\\'s a good maverick along with me now LEHRER: All right  Let\\'s go another subject  Lead question  two minutes to you  senator McCain  Much has been said about the lessons of Vietnam  w hat do you see as the lessons of Iraq MCCAIN: I think the lessons of Iraq are very clear that you cannot have a failed strategy that will then cause you to nearly lose a conflict  Our initial military success  we went in to Baghdad and everybody celebrated  And then the war was very badly mishandled  I went to Iraq in 2003 and came back and said  we\\'ve got to change this strategy  This strategy requires additional troops  it requires a fundamental change in strategy and I fought for it  And finally  we came up with a great general and a strategy that has succeeded This strategy has succeeded  And we are winning in Iraq  And we will come home with victory and with honor  And that withdrawal is the result of every counterinsurgency that succeeds MCCAIN: And I want to tell you that now that we will succeed and our troops will come home  and not in defeat  that we will see a stable ally in the region and a fledgling democracy The consequences of defeat would have been increased Iranian influence  It would have been increase in sectarian violence  It would have been a wider war  which the United States of America might have had to come back So there was a lot at stake there  And thanks to this great general  David Petraeus  and the troops who serve under him  they have succeeded  And we are winning in Iraq  and we will come home  And we will come home as we have when we have won other wars and not in defeat LEHRER: Two minutes  how you see the lessons of Iraq  Senator Obama OBAMA: w ell  this is an area where Senator McCain and I have a fundamental difference because I think the first question is whether we should have gone into the war in the first place Now six years ago  I stood up and opposed this war at a time when it was politically risky to do so because I said that not only did we not know how much it was going to cost  what our exit strategy might be  how it would affect our relationships around the world  and whether our intelligence was sound  but also because we hadn\\'t finished the job in Afghanistan w e hadn\\'t caught bin Laden  w e hadn\\'t put al Qaeda to rest  and as a consequence  I thought that it was going to be a distraction  Now Senator McCain and President Bush had a very different judgment And I wish I had been wrong for the sake of the country and they had been right  but that\\'s not the case  w e\\'ve spent over $600 billion so far  soon to be $1 trillion  w e have lost over 4 000 lives  w e have seen 30 000 wounded  and most importantly  from a strategic national security perspective  al Qaeda is resurgent  stronger now than at any time since 2001 w e took our eye off the ball  And not to mention that we are still spending $10 billion a month  when they have a $79 billion surplus  at a time when we are in great distress here at home  and we just talked about the fact that our budget is way overstretched and we are borrowing money from overseas to try to finance just some of the basic functions of our government So I think the lesson to be drawn is that we should never hesitate to use military force  and I will not  as president  in order to keep the American people safe  But we have to use our military wisely  And we did not use our military wisely in Iraq LEHRER: Do you agree with that  the lesson of Iraq MCCAIN: The next president of the United States is not going to have to address the issue as to whether we went into Iraq or not  The next president of the United States is going to have to decide how we leave  when we leave  and what we leave behind  That\\'s the decision of the next president of the United States Senator Obama said the surge could not work  said it would increase sectarian violence  said it was doomed to failure  Recently on a television program  he said it exceed our wildest expectations But yet  after conceding that  he still says that he would oppose the surge if he had to decide that again today  Incredibly  incredibly Senator Obama didn\\'t go to Iraq for 900 days and never asked for a meeting with General Petraeus LEHRER: w ell  let\\'s go at some of these things   MCCAIN: Senator Obama is the chairperson of a committee that oversights NATO that\\'s in Afghanistan  To this day  he has never had a hearing LEHRER: w hat about that point MCCAIN: I mean  it\\'s remarkable LEHRER: All right  w hat about that point OBAMA: w hich point  He raised a whole bunch of them LEHRER: I know  OK  let\\'s go to the latter point and we\\'ll back up  The point about your not having been   OBAMA: Look  I\\'m very proud of my vice presidential selection  Joe Biden  who is the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee  and as he explains  and as John well knows  the issues of Afghanistan  the issues of Iraq  critical issues like that  don\\'t go through my subcommittee because they\\'re done as a committee as a whole But that\\'s Senate inside baseball  But let\\'s get back to the core issue here  Senator McCain is absolutely right that the violence has been reduced as a consequence of the extraordinary sacrifice of our troops and our military families They have done a brilliant job  and General Petraeus has done a brilliant job  But understand  that was a tactic designed to contain the damage of the previous four years of mismanagement of this war And so John likes    John  you like to pretend like the war started in 2007  You talk about the surge  The war started in 2003  and at the time when the war started  you said it was going to be quick and easy  You said we knew where the weapons of mass destruction were  You were wrong You said that we were going to be greeted as liberators  You were wrong  You said that there was no history of violence between Shia and Sunni  And you were wrong  And so my question is   (CROSSTALK)LEHRER: Senator Obama   OBAMA:     of judgment  of whether or not    of whether or not    if the question is who is best equipped as the next president to make good decisions about how we use our military  how we make sure that we are prepared and ready for the next conflict  then I think we can take a look at our judgment LEHRER: I have got a lot on the plate here   MCCAIN: I\\'m afraid Senator Obama doesn\\'t understand the difference between a tactic and a strategy  But the important    I\\'d like to tell you  two Fourths of July ago I was in Baghdad  General Petraeus invited Senator Lindsey Graham and me to attend a ceremony where 688 brave young Americans  whose enlistment had expired  were reenlisting to stay and fight for Iraqi freedom and American freedom I was honored to be there  I was honored to speak to those troops  And you know  afterwards  we spent a lot of time with them  And you know what they said to us  They said  let us win  They said  let us win  w e don\\'t want our kids coming back here And this strategy  and this general  they are winning  Senator Obama refuses to acknowledge that we are winning in Iraq OBAMA: That\\'s not true MCCAIN: They just passed an electoral   OBAMA: That\\'s not true MCCAIN: An election law just in the last few days  There is social  economic progress  and a strategy  a strategy of going into an area  clearing and holding  and the people of the country then become allied with you  They inform on the bad guys  And peace comes to the country  and prosperity That\\'s what\\'s happening in Iraq  and it wasn\\'t a tactic LEHRER: Let me see   OBAMA: Jim  Jim  this is a big   MCCAIN: It was a strategy  And that same strategy will be employed in Afghanistan by this great general  And Senator Obama  who after promising not to vote to cut off funds for the troops  did the incredible thing of voting to cut off the funds for the troops in Iraq and Afghanistan OBAMA: Jim  there are a whole bunch of things we have got to answer  First of all  let\\'s talk about this troop funding issue because John always brings this up  Senator McCain cut    Senator McCain opposed funding for troops in legislation that had a timetable  because he didn\\'t believe in a timetable I opposed funding a mission that had no timetable  and was open  ended  giving a blank check to George Bush  w e had a difference on the timetable  w e didn\\'t have a difference on whether or not we were going to be funding troops w e had a legitimate difference  and I absolutely understand the difference between tactics and strategy  And the strategic question that the president has to ask is not whether or not we are employing a particular approach in the country once we have made the decision to be there The question is  was this wise  w e have seen Afghanistan worsen  deteriorate  w e need more troops there  w e need more resources there  Senator McCain  in the rush to go into Iraq  said  you know what  w e\\'ve been successful in Afghanistan  There is nobody who can pose a threat to us there This is a time when bin Laden was still out  and now they\\'ve reconstituted themselves  Secretary of Defense Robert Gates himself acknowledges the war on terrorism started in Afghanistan and it needs to end there But we can\\'t do it if we are not willing to give Iraq back its country  Now  what I\\'ve said is we should end this war responsibly  w e should do it in phases  But in 16 months we should be able to reduce our combat troops  put    provide some relief to military families and our troops and bolster our efforts in Afghanistan so that we can capture and kill bin Laden and crush al Qaeda And right now  the commanders in Afghanistan  as well as Admiral Mullen  have acknowledged that we don\\'t have enough troops to deal with Afghanistan because we still have more troops in Iraq than we did before the surge MCCAIN: Admiral Mullen suggests that Senator Obama\\'s plan is dangerous for America OBAMA: That\\'s not the case MCCAIN: That\\'s what    OBAMA: w hat he said was a precipitous   MCCAIN: That\\'s what Admiral Mullen said OBAMA:     withdrawal would be dangerous  He did not say that  That\\'s not true MCCAIN: And also General Petraeus said the same thing  Osama bin Laden and General Petraeus have one thing in common that I know of  they both said that Iraq is the central battleground Now General Petraeus has praised the successes  but he said those successes are fragile and if we set a specific date for withdrawal    and by the way  Senator Obama\\'s original plan  they would have been out last spring before the surge ever had a chance to succeed And I\\'m    I\\'m    understand why Senator Obama was surprised and said that the surge succeeded beyond his wildest expectations MCCAIN: It didn\\'t exceed beyond mine  because I know that that\\'s a strategy that has worked and can succeed  But if we snatch defeat from the jaws of victory and adopt Senator Obama\\'s plan  then we will have a wider war and it will make things more complicated throughout the region  including in Afghanistan LEHRER: Afghanistan  lead    a new    a new lead question  Now  having resolved Iraq  we\\'ll move to Afghanistan (LAUGHTER)And it goes to you  Senator Obama  and it\\'s a    it picks up on a point that\\'s already been made  Do you think more troops    more U S  troops should be sent to Afghanistan  how many  and when OBAMA: Yes  I think we need more troops  I\\'ve been saying that for over a year now And I think that we have to do it as quickly as possible  because it\\'s been acknowledged by the commanders on the ground the situation is getting worse  not better w e had the highest fatalities among U S  troops this past year than at any time since 2002  And we are seeing a major offensive taking place    Al Qaida and Taliban crossing the border and attacking our troops in a brazen fashion  They are feeling emboldened And we cannot separate Afghanistan from Iraq  because what our commanders have said is we don\\'t have the troops right now to deal with Afghanistan So I would send two to three additional brigades to Afghanistan  Now  keep in mind that we have four times the number of troops in Iraq  where nobody had anything to do with 9/11 before we went in  where  in fact  there was no Al Qaida before we went in  but we have four times more troops there than we do in Afghanistan And that is a strategic mistake  because every intelligence agency will acknowledge that Al Qaida is the greatest threat against the United States and that Secretary of Defense Gates acknowledged the central front    that the place where we have to deal with these folks is going to be in Afghanistan and in Pakistan So here\\'s what we have to do comprehensively  though  It\\'s not just more troops w e have to press the Afghan government to make certain that they are actually working for their people  And I\\'ve said this to President Karzai Number two  we\\'ve got to deal with a growing poppy trade that has exploded over the last several years Number three  we\\'ve got to deal with Pakistan  because Al Qaida and the Taliban have safe havens in Pakistan  across the border in the northwest regions  and although  you know  under George Bush  with the support of Senator McCain  we\\'ve been giving them $10 billion over the last seven years  they have not done what needs to be done to get rid of those safe havens And until we do  Americans here at home are not going to be safe LEHRER: Afghanistan  Senator McCain MCCAIN: First of all  I won\\'t repeat the mistake that I regret enormously  and that is  after we were able to help the Afghan freedom fighters and drive the Russians out of Afghanistan  we basically washed our hands of the region And the result over time was the Taliban  Al Qaida  and a lot of the difficulties we are facing today  So we can\\'t ignore those lessons of history Now  on this issue of aiding Pakistan  if you\\'re going to aim a gun at somebody  George Shultz  our great secretary of state  told me once  you\\'d better be prepared to pull the trigger I\\'m not prepared at this time to cut off aid to Pakistan  So I\\'m not prepared to threaten it  as Senator Obama apparently wants to do  as he has said that he would announce military strikes into Pakistan w e\\'ve got to get the support of the people of    of Pakistan  He said that he would launch military strikes into Pakistan Now  you don\\'t do that  You don\\'t say that out loud  If you have to do things  you have to do things  and you work with the Pakistani government Now  the new president of Pakistan  Kardari (sic)  has got his hands full  And this area on the border has not been governed since the days of Alexander the Great I\\'ve been to w aziristan  I can see how tough that terrain is  It\\'s ruled by a handful of tribes And  yes  Senator Obama calls for more troops  but what he doesn\\'t understand  it\\'s got to be a new strategy  the same strategy that he condemned in Iraq  It\\'s going to have to be employed in Afghanistan And we\\'re going to have to help the Pakistanis go into these areas and obtain the allegiance of the people  And it\\'s going to be tough  They\\'ve intermarried with Al Qaida and the Taliban  And it\\'s going to be tough  But we have to get the cooperation of the people in those areas And the Pakistanis are going to have to understand that that bombing in the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad was a signal from the terrorists that they don\\'t want that government to cooperate with us in combating the Taliban and jihadist elements So we\\'ve got a lot of work to do in Afghanistan  But I\\'m confident  now that General Petraeus is in the new position of command  that we will employ a strategy which not only means additional troops    and  by the way  there have been 20 000 additional troops  from 32 000 to 53 000  and there needs to be more So it\\'s not just the addition of troops that matters  It\\'s a strategy that will succeed  And Pakistan is a very important element in this  And I know how to work with them  And I guarantee you I would not publicly state that I\\'m going to attack them OBAMA: Nobody talked about attacking Pakistan  Here\\'s what I said And if John wants to disagree with this  he can let me know  that  if the United States has Al Qaida  bin Laden  top level lieutenants in our sights  and Pakistan is unable or unwilling to act  then we should take them out Now  I think that\\'s the right strategy; I think that\\'s the right policy And  John  I    you\\'re absolutely right that presidents have to be prudent in what they say  But  you know  coming from you  who  you know  in the past has threatened extinction for North Korea and  you know  sung songs about bombing Iran  I don\\'t know  you know  how credible that is  I think this is the right strategy Now  Senator McCain is also right that it\\'s difficult  This is not an easy situation  You\\'ve got cross border attacks against U S  troops And we\\'ve got a choice  w e could allow our troops to just be on the defensive and absorb those blows again and again and again  if Pakistan is unwilling to cooperate  or we have to start making some decisions And the problem  John  with the strategy that\\'s been pursued was that  for 10 years  we coddled Musharraf  we alienated the Pakistani population  because we were anti democratic  w e had a 20th century mindset that basically said  \"w ell  you know  he may be a dictator  but he\\'s our dictator \"And as a consequence  we lost legitimacy in Pakistan  w e spent $10 billion  And in the meantime  they weren\\'t going after Al Qaida  and they are more powerful now than at any time since we began the war in Afghanistan That\\'s going to change when I\\'m president of the United States MCCAIN: I    I don\\'t think that Senator Obama understands that there was a failed state in Pakistan when Musharraf came to power  Everybody who was around then  and had been there  and knew about it knew that it was a failed state But let me tell you  you know  this business about bombing Iran and all that  let me tell you my record Back in 1983  when I was a brand new United States congressman  the one    the person I admired the most and still admire the most  Ronald Reagan  wanted to send Marines into Lebanon And I saw that  and I saw the situation  and I stood up  and I voted against that  because I was afraid that they couldn\\'t make peace in a place where 300 or 400 or several hundred Marines would make a difference  Tragically  I was right: Nearly 300 Marines lost their lives in the bombing of the barracks And then we had Somalia    then we had the first Gulf w ar  I supported    I supported that I supported us going into Bosnia  when a number of my own party and colleagues was against that operation in Bosnia  That was the right thing to do  to stop genocide and to preserve what was necessary inside of Europe I supported what we did in Kosovo  I supported it because ethnic cleansing and genocide was taking place there And I have a record    and Somalia  I opposed that we should turn    turn the force in Somalia from a peacekeeping force into a peacemaking force  which they were not capable of So I have a record  I have a record of being involved in these national security issues  which involve the highest responsibility and the toughest decisions that any president can make  and that is to send our young men and women into harm\\'s way And I\\'ll tell you  I had a town hall meeting in w olfeboro  New Hampshire  and a woman stood up and she said  \"Senator McCain  I want you to do me the honor of wearing a bracelet with my son\\'s name on it \"He was 22 years old and he was killed in combat outside of Baghdad  Matthew Stanley  before Christmas last year  This was last August  a year ago  And I said  \"I will    I will wear his bracelet with honor \"And this was August  a year ago  And then she said  \"But  Senator McCain  I want you to do everything    promise me one thing  that you\\'ll do everything in your power to make sure that my son\\'s death was not in vain \"That means that that mission succeeds  just like those young people who re enlisted in Baghdad  just like the mother I met at the airport the other day whose son was killed  And they all say to me that we don\\'t want defeat  I know what thatâ€™s like when an army is defeated MCCAIN: A war that I was in  where we had an Army  that it wasn\\'t through any fault of their own  but they were defeated  And I know how hard it is for that    for an Army and a military to recover from that  And it did and we will win this one and we won\\'t come home in defeat and dishonor and probably have to go back if we fail OBAMA: Jim  let me just make a point  I\\'ve got a bracelet  too  from Sergeant   from the mother of Sergeant Ryan David Jopeck (ph)  given to me in green bay  She asked me  can you please make sure another mother is not going through what I\\'m going through No U S  soldier ever dies in vain because they\\'re carrying out the missions of their commander in chief  And we honor all the service that they\\'ve provided  Our troops have performed brilliantly  The question is for the next president  are we making good judgments about how to keep America safe precisely because sending our military into battle is such an enormous step And the point that I originally made is that we took our eye off Afghanistan  we took our eye off the folks who perpetrated 9/11  they are still sending out videotapes and Senator McCain  nobody is talking about defeat in Iraq  but I have to say we are having enormous problems in Afghanistan because of that decision And it is not true you have consistently been concerned about what happened in Afghanistan  At one point  while you were focused on Iraq  you said well  we can \"muddle through\" Afghanistan  You don\\'t muddle through the central front on terror and you don\\'t muddle through going after bin Laden  You don\\'t muddle through stamping out the Taliban I think that is something we have to take seriously  And when I\\'m president  I will LEHRER: New    MCCAIN: You might think that with that kind of concern that Senator Obama would have gone to Afghanistan  particularly given his responsibilities as a subcommittee chairman  By the way  when I\\'m subcommittee chairman  we take up the issues under my subcommittee  But the important thing is    the important thing is I visited Afghanistan and I traveled to w aziristan and I traveled to these places and I know what our security requirements are  I know what our needs are  So the point is that we will prevail in Afghanistan  but we need the new strategy and we need it to succeed But the important thing is  if we suffer defeat in Iraq  which General Petraeus predicts we will  if we adopted Senator Obama\\'s set date for withdrawal  then that will have a calamitous effect in Afghanistan and American national security interests in the region  Senator Obama doesn\\'t seem to understand there is a connected between the two LEHRER: I have some good news and bad news for the two of you  You all are even on time  which is remarkable  considering we\\'ve been going at it    OBAMA: A testimony to you  Jim LEHRER: I don\\'t know about that  But the bad news is all my little five minute things have run over  so  anyhow  we\\'ll adjust as we get there  But the amount of time is even New lead question  And it goes two minutes to you  Senator McCain  what is your reading on the threat from Iran right now to the security of the United States MCCAIN: My reading of the threat from Iran is that if Iran acquires nuclear weapons  it is an existential threat to the State of Israel and it is a threat to other countries in the region because the other countries in the region will feel compelling requirement to acquire nuclear weapons as well Now we cannot allow a second Holocaust  Let\\'s just make that very clear  w hat I have proposed for a long time  and I\\'ve had conversation with foreign leaders about forming a league of democracies  let\\'s be clear and let\\'s have some straight talk  The Russians are preventing significant action in the United Nations Security Council I have proposed a league of democracies  a group of people   a group of countries that share common interests  common values  common ideals  they also control a lot of the world\\'s economic power  w e could impose significant meaningful  painful sanctions on the Iranians that I think could have a beneficial effect The Iranians have a lousy government  so therefore their economy is lousy  even though they have significant oil revenues  So I am convinced that together  we can  with the French  with the British  with the Germans and other countries  democracies around the world  we can affect Iranian behavior But have no doubt  but have no doubt that the Iranians continue on the path to the acquisition of a nuclear weapon as we speak tonight  And it is a threat not only in this region but around the world w hat I\\'d also like to point out the Iranians are putting the most lethal IEDs into Iraq which are killing young Americans  there are special groups in Iran coming into Iraq and are being trained in Iran  There is the Republican Guard in Iran  which Senator Kyl had an amendment in order to declare them a sponsor of terror  Senator Obama said that would be provocative So this is a serious threat  This is a serious threat to security in the world  and I believe we can act and we can act with our friends and allies and reduce that threat as quickly as possible  but have no doubt about the ultimate result of them acquiring nuclear weapons LEHRER: Two minutes on Iran  Senator Obama OBAMA: w ell  let me just correct something very quickly  I believe the Republican Guard of Iran is a terrorist organization  I\\'ve consistently said so  w hat Senator McCain refers to is a measure in the Senate that would try to broaden the mandate inside of Iraq  To deal with Iran And ironically  the single thing that has strengthened Iran over the last several years has been the war in Iraq  Iraq was Iran\\'s mortal enemy  That was cleared away  And what we\\'ve seen over the last several years is Iran\\'s influence grow  They have funded Hezbollah  they have funded Hamas  they have gone from zero centrifuges to 4 000 centrifuges to develop a nuclear weapon So obviously  our policy over the last eight years has not worked  Senator McCain is absolutely right  we cannot tolerate a nuclear Iran  It would be a game changer  Not only would it threaten Israel  a country that is our stalwart ally  but it would also create an environment in which you could set off an arms race in this Middle East Now here\\'s what we need to do  w e do need tougher sanctions  I do not agree with Senator McCain that we\\'re going to be able to execute the kind of sanctions we need without some cooperation with countries like Russia and China that are  I think Senator McCain would agree  not democracies  but have extensive trade with Iran but potentially have an interest in making sure Iran doesn\\'t have a nuclear weapon But we are also going to have to  I believe  engage in tough direct diplomacy with Iran and this is a major difference I have with Senator McCain  this notion that by not talking to people we are punishing them has not worked  It has not worked in Iran  it has not worked in North Korea  In each instance  our efforts at isolation have actually accelerated their efforts to get nuclear weapons  That will change when I\\'m president of the United States LEHRER: Senator  what about talking MCCAIN: Senator Obama twice said in debates he would sit down with Ahmadinejad  Chavez and Raul Castro without precondition  w ithout precondition  Here is Ahmadinenene (ph)  Ahmadinejad  who is  Ahmadinejad  who is now in New York  talking about the extermination of the State of Israel  of wiping Israel off the map  and we\\'re going to sit down  without precondition  across the table  to legitimize and give a propaganda platform to a person that is espousing the extermination of the state of Israel  and therefore then giving them more credence in the world arena and therefore saying  they\\'ve probably been doing the right thing  because you will sit down across the table from them and that will legitimize their illegal behavior The point is that throughout history  whether it be Ronald Reagan  who wouldn\\'t sit down with Brezhnev  Andropov or Chernenko until Gorbachev was ready with glasnost and perestroika Or whether it be Nixon\\'s trip to China  which was preceded by Henry Kissinger  many times before he went  Look  I\\'ll sit down with anybody  but there\\'s got to be pre conditions  Those pre conditions would apply that we wouldn\\'t legitimize with a face to face meeting  a person like Ahmadinejad  Now  Senator Obama said  without preconditions OBAMA: So let\\'s talk about this  First of all  Ahmadinejad is not the most powerful person in Iran  So he may not be the right person to talk to  But I reserve the right  as president of the United States to meet with anybody at a time and place of my choosing if I think it\\'s going to keep America safe And I\\'m glad that Senator McCain brought up the history  the bipartisan history of us engaging in direct diplomacy OBAMA: Senator McCain mentioned Henry Kissinger  who\\'s one of his advisers  who  along with five recent secretaries of state  just said that we should meet with Iran    guess what    without precondition  This is one of your own advisers Now  understand what this means \"without preconditions \" It doesn\\'t mean that you invite them over for tea one day  w hat it means is that we don\\'t do what we\\'ve been doing  which is to say  \"Until you agree to do exactly what we say  we won\\'t have direct contacts with you \"There\\'s a difference between preconditions and preparation  Of course we\\'ve got to do preparations  starting with low level diplomatic talks  and it may not work  because Iran is a rogue regime  But I will point out that I was called naive when I suggested that we need to look at exploring contacts with Iran  And you know what  President Bush recently sent a senior ambassador  Bill Burns  to participate in talks with the Europeans around the issue of nuclear weapons Again  it may not work  but if it doesn\\'t work  then we have strengthened our ability to form alliances to impose the tough sanctions that Senator McCain just mentioned And when we haven\\'t done it  as in North Korea    let me just take one more example    in North Korea  we cut off talks  They\\'re a member of the axis of evil  w e can\\'t deal with them And you know what happened  They went    they quadrupled their nuclear capacity  They tested a nuke  They tested missiles  They pulled out of the nonproliferation agreement  And they sent nuclear secrets  potentially  to countries like Syria w hen we re engaged    because  again  the Bush administration reversed course on this    then we have at least made some progress  although right now  because of the problems in North Korea  we are seeing it on shaky ground And    and I just    so I just have to make this general point that the Bush administration  some of Senator McCain\\'s own advisers all think this is important  and Senator McCain appears resistant He even said the other day that he would not meet potentially with the prime minister of Spain  because he    you know  he wasn\\'t sure whether they were aligned with us  I mean  Spain  Spain is a NATO ally MCCAIN: Of course OBAMA: If we can\\'t meet with our friends  I don\\'t know how we\\'re going to lead the world in terms of dealing with critical issues like terrorism MCCAIN: I\\'m not going to set the w hite House visitors schedule before I\\'m president of the United States  I don\\'t even have a seal yet Look  Dr  Kissinger did not say that he would approve of face to  face meetings between the president of the United States and the president    and Ahmadinejad  He did not say that OBAMA: Of course not MCCAIN: He said that there could be secretary level and lower level meetings  I\\'ve always encouraged them  The Iranians have met with Ambassador Crocker in Baghdad w hat Senator Obama doesn\\'t seem to understand that if without precondition you sit down across the table from someone who has called Israel a \"stinking corpse \" and wants to destroy that country and wipe it off the map  you legitimize those comments This is dangerous  It isn\\'t just naive; it\\'s dangerous  And so we just have a fundamental difference of opinion As far as North Korea is concerned  our secretary of state  Madeleine Albright  went to North Korea  By the way  North Korea  most repressive and brutal regime probably on Earth  The average South Korean is three inches taller than the average North Korean  a huge gulag w e don\\'t know what the status of the dear leader\\'s health is today  but we know this  that the North Koreans have broken every agreement that they\\'ve entered into And we ought to go back to a little bit of Ronald Reagan\\'s \"trust  but verify \" and certainly not sit down across the table from    without precondition  as Senator Obama said he did twice  I mean  it\\'s just dangerous OBAMA: Look  I mean  Senator McCain keeps on using this example that suddenly the president would just meet with somebody without doing any preparation  without having low level talks  Nobody\\'s been talking about that  and Senator McCain knows it  This is a mischaracterization of my position w hen we talk about preconditions    and Henry Kissinger did say we should have contacts without preconditions    the idea is that we do not expect to solve every problem before we initiate talks And  you know  the Bush administration has come to recognize that it hasn\\'t worked  this notion that we are simply silent when it comes to our enemies  And the notion that we would sit with Ahmadinejad and not say anything while he\\'s spewing his nonsense and his vile comments is ridiculous  Nobody is even talking about that MCCAIN: So let me get this right  w e sit down with Ahmadinejad  and he says  \"w e\\'re going to wipe Israel off the face of the Earth \" and we say  \"No  you\\'re not\"  Oh  please OBAMA: No  let me tell   (CROSSTALK)MCCAIN: By the way  my friend  Dr  Kissinger  who\\'s been my friend for 35 years  would be interested to hear this conversation and Senator Obama\\'s depiction of his    of his positions on the issue  I\\'ve known him for 35 years OBAMA: w e will take a look MCCAIN: And I guarantee you he would not    he would not say that presidential top level OBAMA: Nobody\\'s talking about that MCCAIN: Of course he encourages and other people encourage contacts  and negotiations  and all other things  w e do that all the time LEHRER: w e\\'re going to go to a new   (CROSSTALK)MCCAIN: And Senator Obama is parsing words when he says precondition means preparation OBAMA: I am not parsing words MCCAIN: He\\'s parsing words  my friends OBAMA: I\\'m using the same words that your advisers use Please  go ahead LEHRER: New lead question Russia  goes to you  two minutes  Senator Obama  How do you see the relationship with Russia  Do you see them as a competitor  Do you see them as an enemy  Do you see them as a potential partner OBAMA: w ell  I think that  given what\\'s happened over the last several weeks and months  our entire Russian approach has to be evaluated  because a resurgent and very aggressive Russia is a threat to the peace and stability of the region Their actions in Georgia were unacceptable  They were unwarranted  And at this point  it is absolutely critical for the next president to make clear that we have to follow through on our six party    or the six point cease fire  They have to remove themselves from South Ossetia and Abkhazia It is absolutely important that we have a unified alliance and that we explain to the Russians that you cannot be a 21st century superpower  or power  and act like a 20th century dictatorship And we also have to affirm all the fledgling democracies in that region  you know  the Estonians  the Lithuanians  the Latvians  the Poles  the Czechs  that we are  in fact  going to be supportive and in solidarity with them in their efforts  They are members of NATO And to countries like Georgia and the Ukraine  I think we have to insist that they are free to join NATO if they meet the requirements  and they should have a membership action plan immediately to start bringing them in Now  we also can\\'t return to a Cold w ar posture with respect to Russia  It\\'s important that we recognize there are going to be some areas of common interest  One is nuclear proliferation They have not only 15 000 nuclear warheads  but they\\'ve got enough to make another 40 000  and some of those loose nukes could fall into the hands of Al Qaida This is an area where I\\'ve led on in the Senate  working with a Republican ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee  Dick Lugar  to deal with the proliferation of loose nuclear weapons  That\\'s an area where we\\'re going to have to work with Russia But we have to have a president who is clear that you don\\'t deal with Russia based on staring into his eyes and seeing his soul  You deal with Russia based on  what are your    what are the national security interests of the United States of America And we have to recognize that the way they\\'ve been behaving lately demands a sharp response from the international community and our allies LEHRER: Two minutes on Russia  Senator McCain MCCAIN: w ell  I was interested in Senator Obama\\'s reaction to the Russian aggression against Georgia  His first statement was  \"Both sides ought to show restraint \"Again  a little bit of naivete there  He doesn\\'t understand that Russia committed serious aggression against Georgia  And Russia has now become a nation fueled by petro dollars that is basically a KGB apparatchik run government I looked into Mr  Putin\\'s eyes  and I saw three letters  a \"K \" a \"G \" and a \"B \" And their aggression in Georgia is not acceptable behavior I don\\'t believe we\\'re going to go back to the Cold w ar  I am sure that that will not happen  But I do believe that we need to bolster our friends and allies  And that wasn\\'t just about a problem between Georgia and Russia  It had everything to do with energy There\\'s a pipeline that runs from the Caspian through Georgia through Turkey  And  of course  we know that the Russians control other sources of energy into Europe  which they have used from time to time It\\'s not accidental that the presidents of Latvia  Estonia  Lithuania  Poland  and Ukraine flew to Georgia  flew to Tbilisi  where I have spent significant amount of time with a great young president  Misha Saakashvili MCCAIN: And they showed solidarity with them  but  also  they are very concerned about the Russian threats to regain their status of the old Russian to regain their status of the old Russian empire Now  I think the Russians ought to understand that we will support    we  the United States    will support the inclusion of Georgia and Ukraine in the natural process  inclusion into NATO w e also ought to make it very clear that the Russians are in violation of their cease fire agreement  They have stationed additional troops in Abkhazia and South Ossetia By the way  I went there once  and we went inside and drove in  and there was a huge poster  And this is    this is Georgian territory  And there was a huge poster of Vladimir Putin  and it said  \"Vladimir Putin  our president \"It was very clear  the Russian intentions towards Georgia  They were just waiting to seize the opportunity So  this is a very difficult situation  w e want to work with the Russians  But we also have every right to expect the Russians to behave in a fashion and keeping with a    with a    with a country who respects international boundaries and the norms of international behavior And watch Ukraine  This whole thing has got a lot to do with Ukraine  Crimea  the base of the Russian fleet in Sevastopol  And the breakdown of the political process in Ukraine between Tymoshenko and Yushchenko is a very serious problem So watch Ukraine  and let\\'s make sure that we    that the Ukrainians understand that we are their friend and ally LEHRER: You see any    do you have a major difference with what he just said OBAMA: No  actually  I think Senator McCain and I agree for the most part on these issues  Obviously  I disagree with this notion that somehow we did not forcefully object to Russians going into Georgia I immediately said that this was illegal and objectionable  And  absolutely  I wanted a cessation of the violence  because it put an enormous strain on Georgia  and that\\'s why I was the first to say that we have to rebuild the Georgian economy and called for a billion dollars that has now gone in to help them rebuild Because part of Russia\\'s intentions here was to weaken the economy to the point where President Saakashvili was so weakened that he might be replaced by somebody that Putin favored more Two points I think are important to think about when it comes to Russia Number one is we have to have foresight and anticipate some of these problems  So back in April  I warned the administration that you had Russian peacekeepers in Georgian territory  That made no sense whatsoever And what we needed to do was replace them with international peacekeepers and a special envoy to resolve the crisis before it boiled over That wasn\\'t done  But had it been done  it\\'s possible we could have avoided the issue The second point I want to make is    is the issue of energy  Russia is in part resurgent and Putin is feeling powerful because of petro dollars  as Senator McCain mentioned That means that we  as one of the biggest consumers of oil    25 percent of the world\\'s oil    have to have an energy strategy not just to deal with Russia  but to deal with many of the rogue states we\\'ve talked about  Iran  Venezuela And that means  yes  increasing domestic production and off shore drilling  but we only have 3 percent of the world\\'s oil supplies and we use 25 percent of the world\\'s oil  So we can\\'t simply drill our way out of the problem w hat we\\'re going to have to do is to approach it through alternative energy  like solar  and wind  and biodiesel  and  yes  nuclear energy  clean coal technology  And  you know  I\\'ve got a plan for us to make a significant investment over the next 10 years to do that And I have to say  Senator McCain and I  I think agree on the importance of energy  but Senator McCain mentioned earlier the importance of looking at a record Over 26 years  Senator McCain voted 23 times against alternative energy  like solar  and wind  and biodiesel And so we    we    we\\'ve got to walk the walk and not just talk the talk when it comes to energy independence  because this is probably going to be just as vital for our economy and the pain that people are feeling at the pump    and  you know  winter\\'s coming and home heating oil    as it is our national security and the issue of climate change that\\'s so important LEHRER: w e\\'ve got time for one more lead question segment  w e\\'re way out of   (CROSSTALK)LEHRER: Quick response and then   (CROSSTALK)MCCAIN: No one from Arizona is against solar  And Senator Obama says he\\'s for nuclear  but he\\'s against reprocessing and he\\'s against storing  So   OBAMA: That\\'s just not true  John  John  I\\'m sorry  but that\\'s not true MCCAIN:     it\\'s hard to get there from here  And off shore drilling is also something that is very important and it is a bridge And we know that  if we drill off shore and exploit a lot of these reserves  it will help  at temporarily  relieve our energy requirements  And it will have  I think  an important effect on the price of a barrel of oil OBAMA: I just have to respond very quickly  just to correct    just to correct the record MCCAIN: So I want to say that  with the Nunn Lugar thing   LEHRER: Excuse me  Senator OBAMA: John MCCAIN:     I supported Nunn Lugar back in the early 1990s when a lot of my colleagues didn\\'t  That was the key legislation at the time and put us on the road to eliminating this issue of nuclear waste and the nuclear fuel that has to be taken care of OBAMA: I    I just have to correct the record here  I have never said that I object to nuclear waste  w hat I\\'ve said is that we have to store it safely And  Senator McCain  he says    he talks about Arizona LEHRER: All right OBAMA: I\\'ve got to make this point  Jim LEHRER: OK OBAMA: He objects   MCCAIN: I have voted for alternate fuel all of my time   OBAMA: He    he    he objects   (CROSSTALK)LEHRER: One at a time  please OBAMA: He objected   LEHRER: One at a time MCCAIN: No one can be opposed to alternate energy OBAMA: All right  fair enough  Let\\'s move on  You\\'ve got one more energy    you\\'ve got one more question LEHRER: This is the last    last lead question  You have two minutes each  And the question is this  beginning with you  Senator McCain w hat do you think the likelihood is that there would be another 9/11 type attack on the continental United States MCCAIN: I think it\\'s much less than it was the day after 9/11  I think it    that we have a safer nation  but we are a long way from safe And I want to tell you that one of the things I\\'m most proud of  among others  because I have worked across the aisle  I have a long record on that  on a long series of reforms But after 9/11  Senator Joe Lieberman and I decided that we needed a commission  and that was a commission to investigate 9/11  and find out what happened  and fix it And we were    we were opposed by the administration  another area where I differed with this administration  And we were stymied until the families of 9/11 came  and they descended on w ashington  and we got that legislation passed And there were a series of recommendations  as I recall  more than 40  And I\\'m happy to say that we\\'ve gotten written into law most of those reforms recommended by that commission  I\\'m proud of that work  again  bipartisan  reaching across the aisle  working together  Democrat and Republican alike So we have a long way to go in our intelligence services  w e have to do a better job in human intelligence  And we\\'ve got to    to make sure that we have people who are trained interrogators so that we don\\'t ever torture a prisoner ever again w e have to make sure that our technological and intelligence capabilities are better  w e have to work more closely with our allies  I know our allies  and I can work much more closely with them But I can tell you that I think America is safer today than it was on 9/11  But that doesn\\'t mean that we don\\'t have a long way to go And I\\'d like to remind you  also  as a result of those recommendations  we\\'ve probably had the largest reorganization of government since we established the Defense Department  And I think that those men and women in those agencies are doing a great job But we still have a long way to go before we can declare America safe  and that means doing a better job along our borders  as well LEHRER: Two minutes  Senator Obama OBAMA: w ell  first of all  I think that we are safer in some ways  Obviously  we\\'ve poured billions of dollars into airport security  w e have done some work in terms of securing potential targets  but we still have a long way to go w e\\'ve got to make sure that we\\'re hardening our chemical sites  w e haven\\'t done enough in terms of transit; we haven\\'t done enough in terms of ports And the biggest threat that we face right now is not a nuclear missile coming over the skies  It\\'s in a suitcase This is why the issue of nuclear proliferation is so important  It is the    the biggest threat to the United States is a terrorist getting their hands on nuclear weapons And we    we are spending billions of dollars on missile defense  And I actually believe that we need missile defense  because of Iran and North Korea and the potential for them to obtain or to launch nuclear weapons  but I also believe that  when we are only spending a few hundred million dollars on nuclear proliferation  then we\\'re making a mistake The other thing that we have to focus on  though  is Al Qaida  They are now operating in 60 countries  w e can\\'t simply be focused on Iraq  w e have to go to the root cause  and that is in Afghanistan and Pakistan  That\\'s going to be critical  w e are going to need more cooperation with our allies And one last point I want to make  It is important for us to understand that the way we are perceived in the world is going to make a difference  in terms of our capacity to get cooperation and root out terrorism And one of the things that I intend to do as president is to restore America\\'s standing in the world  w e are less respected now than we were eight years ago or even four years ago OBAMA: And this is the greatest country on Earth  But because of some of the mistakes that have been made    and I give Senator McCain great credit on the torture issue  for having identified that as something that undermines our long term security    because of those things  we  I think  are going to have a lot of work to do in the next administration to restore that sense that America is that shining beacon on a hill LEHRER: Do you agree there\\'s much to be done in a new administration to restore   (CROSSTALK)MCCAIN: But in the case of missile defense  Senator Obama said it had to be  quote  \"proven \" That wasn\\'t proven when Ronald Reagan said we would do SDI  which is missile defense  And it was major    a major factor in bringing about the end of the Cold w ar w e seem to come full circle again  Senator Obama still doesn\\'t quite understand    or doesn\\'t get it    that if we fail in Iraq  it encourages Al Qaida  They would establish a base in Iraq The consequences of defeat  which would result from his plan of withdrawal and according to date certain  regardless of conditions  according to our military leaders  according to every expert  would lead to defeat    possible defeat  loss of all the fragile sacrifice that we\\'ve made of American blood and treasure  which grieves us all All of that would be lost if we followed Senator Obama\\'s plan to have specific dates with withdrawal  regardless of conditions on the ground And General Petraeus says we have had great success  but it\\'s very fragile  And we can\\'t do what Senator Obama wants to do That is the central issue of our time  And I think Americans will judge very seriously as to whether that\\'s the right path or the wrong path and who should be the next president of the United States LEHRER: You see the same connections that Senator McCain does OBAMA: Oh  there\\'s no doubt  Look  over the last eight years  this administration  along with Senator McCain  have been solely focused on Iraq  That has been their priority  That has been where all our resources have gone In the meantime  bin Laden is still out there  He is not captured  He is not killed  Al Qaida is resurgent In the meantime  we\\'ve got challenges  for example  with China  where we are borrowing billions of dollars  They now hold a trillion dollars\\' worth of our debt  And they are active in countries like    in regions like Latin America  and Asia  and Africa  They are    the conspicuousness of their presence is only matched by our absence  because we\\'ve been focused on Iraq w e have weakened our capacity to project power around the world because we have viewed everything through this single lens  not to mention  look at our economy  w e are now spending $10 billion or more every month And that means we can\\'t provide health care to people who need it  w e can\\'t invest in science and technology  which will determine whether or not we are going to be competitive in the long term There has never been a country on Earth that saw its economy decline and yet maintained its military superiority  So this is a national security issue w e haven\\'t adequately funded veterans\\' care  I sit on the Veterans Affairs Committee  and we\\'ve got    I meet veterans all across the country who are trying to figure out  \"How can I get disability payments  I\\'ve got post traumatic stress disorder  and yet I can\\'t get treatment \"So we have put all chips in  right there  and nobody is talking about losing this war  w hat we are talking about is recognizing that the next president has to have a broader strategic vision about all the challenges that we face That\\'s been missing over the last eight years  That sense is something that I want to restore MCCAIN: I\\'ve been involved  as I mentioned to you before  in virtually every major national security challenge we\\'ve faced in the last 20 some years  There are some advantages to experience  and knowledge  and judgment And I    and I honestly don\\'t believe that Senator Obama has the knowledge or experience and has made the wrong judgments in a number of areas  including his initial reaction to Russian invasion    aggression in Georgia  to his    you know  we\\'ve seen this stubbornness before in this administration to cling to a belief that somehow the surge has not succeeded and failing to acknowledge that he was wrong about the surge is    shows to me that we    that    that we need more flexibility in a president of the United States than that As far as our other issues that he brought up are concerned  I know the veterans  I know them well  And I know that they know that I\\'ll take care of them  And I\\'ve been proud of their support and their recognition of my service to the veterans And I love them  And I\\'ll take care of them  And they know that I\\'ll take care of them  And that\\'s going to be my job But  also  I have the ability  and the knowledge  and the background to make the right judgments  to keep this country safe and secure Reform  prosperity  and peace  these are major challenges to the United States of America  I don\\'t think I need any on the job training  I\\'m ready to go at it right now OBAMA: w ell  let me just make a closing point  You know  my father came from Kenya  That\\'s where I get my name And in the \\'60s  he wrote letter after letter to come to college here in the United States because the notion was that there was no other country on Earth where you could make it if you tried  The ideals and the values of the United States inspired the entire world I don\\'t think any of us can say that our standing in the world now  the way children around the world look at the United States  is the same And part of what we need to do  what the next president has to do    and this is part of our judgment  this is part of how we\\'re going to keep America safe    is to    to send a message to the world that we are going to invest in issues like education  we are going to invest in issues that    that relate to how ordinary people are able to live out their dreams And that is something that I\\'m going to be committed to as president of the United States LEHRER: Few seconds  w e\\'re almost finished MCCAIN: Jim  when I came home from prison  I saw our veterans being very badly treated  and it made me sad  And I embarked on an effort to resolve the POw  MIA issue  which we did in a bipartisan fashion  and then I worked on normalization of relations between our two countries so that our veterans could come all the way home I guarantee you  as president of the United States  I know how to heal the wounds of war  I know how to deal with our adversaries  and I know how to deal with our friends LEHRER: And that ends this debate tonight On October 2nd  next Thursday  also at 9:00 p m  Eastern time  the two vice presidential candidates will debate at w ashington University in St  Louis  My PBS colleague  Gwen Ifill  will be the moderator For now  from

UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI  CORAL GABLES  FLORIDASPEAKERS: GEORGE w   BUSH  PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATESU S  SENATOR JOHN F  KERRY (MA)  DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEEJIM LEHRER  ANCHOR AND EXECUTIVE EDITOR  PBS\\'S \"THE NEw SHOUR\"LEHRER: Good evening from the University of Miami Convocation Center in Coral Gables  Florida  I\\'m Jim Lehrer of \"The NewsHour\" on PBS And I welcome you to the first of the 2004 presidential debates between President George w   Bush  the Republican nominee  and Senator John Kerry  the Democratic nominee These debates are sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates Tonight\\'s will last 90 minutes  following detailed rules of engagement worked out by representatives of the candidates  I have agreed to enforce their rules on them The umbrella topic is foreign policy and homeland security  but the specific subjects were chosen by me  the questions were composed by me  the candidates have not been told what they are  nor has anyone else For each question there can only be a two minute response  a 90  second rebuttal and  at my discretion  a discussion extension of one minute A green light will come on when 30 seconds remain in any given answer  yellow at 15  red at five seconds  and then flashing red means time\\'s up  There is also a backup buzzer system if needed Candidates may not direct a question to each other  There will be two minute closing statements  but no opening statements There is an audience here in the hall  but they will remain absolutely silent for the next 90 minutes  except for now  when they join me in welcoming President Bush and Senator Kerry (APPLAUSE)LEHRER: Good evening  Mr  President  Senator Kerry As determined by a coin toss  the first question goes to you  Senator Kerry  You have two minutes Do you believe you could do a better job than President Bush in preventing another 9/11 type terrorist attack on the United States KERRY: Yes  I do But before I answer further  let me thank you for moderating  I want to thank the University of Miami for hosting us  And I know the president will join me in welcoming all of Florida to this debate  You\\'ve been through the roughest weeks anybody could imagine  Our hearts go out to you  And we admire your pluck and perseverance I can make American safer than President Bush has made us And I believe President Bush and I both love our country equally  But we just have a different set of convictions about how you make America safe I believe America is safest and strongest when we are leading the world and we are leading strong alliances I\\'ll never give a veto to any country over our security  But I also know how to lead those alliances This president has left them in shatters across the globe  and we\\'re now 90 percent of the casualties in Iraq and 90 percent of the costs I think that\\'s wrong  and I think we can do better I have a better plan for homeland security  I have a better plan to be able to fight the war on terror by strengthening our military  strengthening our intelligence  by going after the financing more authoritatively  by doing what we need to do to rebuild the alliances  by reaching out to the Muslim world  which the president has almost not done  and beginning to isolate the radical Islamic Muslims  not have them isolate the United States of America I know I can do a better job in Iraq  I have a plan to have a summit with all of the allies  something this president has not yet achieved  not yet been able to do to bring people to the table w e can do a better job of training the Iraqi forces to defend themselves  and I know that we can do a better job of preparing for elections All of these  and especially homeland security  which we\\'ll talk about a little bit later LEHRER: Mr  President  you have a 90 second rebuttal BUSH: I  too  thank the University of Miami  and say our prayers are with the good people of this state  who\\'ve suffered a lot September the 11th changed how America must look at the world  And since that day  our nation has been on a multi pronged strategy to keep our country safer w e pursued Al Qaida wherever Al Qaida tries to hide  Seventy five percent of known Al Qaida leaders have been brought to justice  The rest of them know we\\'re after them w e\\'ve upheld the doctrine that said if you harbor a terrorist  you\\'re equally as guilty as the terrorist And the Taliban are no longer in power  Ten million people have registered to vote in Afghanistan in the upcoming presidential election In Iraq  we saw a threat  and we realized that after September the 11th  we must take threats seriously  before they fully materialize  Saddam Hussein now sits in a prison cell  America and the world are safer for it  w e continue to pursue our policy of disrupting those who proliferate weapons of mass destruction Libya has disarmed  The A Q  Khan network has been brought to justice And  as well  we\\'re pursuing a strategy of freedom around the world  because I understand free nations will reject terror  Free nations will answer the hopes and aspirations of their people  Free nations will help us achieve the peace we all want LEHRER: New question  Mr  President  two minutes Do you believe the election of Senator Kerry on November the 2nd would increase the chances of the U S  being hit by another 9/11 type terrorist attack BUSH: No  I don\\'t believe it\\'s going to happen  I believe I\\'m going to win  because the American people know I know how to lead  I\\'ve shown the American people I know how to lead I have    I understand everybody in this country doesn\\'t agree with the decisions I\\'ve made  And I made some tough decisions  But people know where I stand People out there listening know what I believe  And that\\'s how best it is to keep the peace This nation of ours has got a solemn duty to defeat this ideology of hate  And that\\'s what they are  This is a group of killers who will not only kill here  but kill children in Russia  that\\'ll attack unmercifully in Iraq  hoping to shake our will w e have a duty to defeat this enemy  w e have a duty to protect our children and grandchildren The best way to defeat them is to never waver  to be strong  to use every asset at our disposal  is to constantly stay on the offensive and  at the same time  spread liberty And that\\'s what people are seeing now is happening in Afghanistan Ten million citizens have registered to vote  It\\'s a phenomenal statistic  That if given a chance to be free  they will show up at the polls  Forty one percent of those 10 million are women In Iraq  no doubt about it  it\\'s tough  It\\'s hard work  It\\'s incredibly hard  You know why  Because an enemy realizes the stakes  The enemy understands a free Iraq will be a major defeat in their ideology of hatred  That\\'s why they\\'re fighting so vociferously They showed up in Afghanistan when they were there  because they tried to beat us and they didn\\'t  And they\\'re showing up in Iraq for the same reason  They\\'re trying to defeat us And if we lose our will  we lose  But if we remain strong and resolute  we will defeat this enemy LEHRER: Ninety second response  Senator Kerry KERRY: I believe in being strong and resolute and determined  And I will hunt down and kill the terrorists  wherever they are But we also have to be smart  Jim  And smart means not diverting your attention from the real war on terror in Afghanistan against Osama bin Laden and taking if off to Iraq where the 9/11 Commission confirms there was no connection to 9/11 itself and Saddam Hussein  and where the reason for going to war was weapons of mass destruction  not the removal of Saddam Hussein This president has made  I regret to say  a colossal error of judgment  And judgment is what we look for in the president of the United States of America I\\'m proud that important military figures who are supporting me in this race: former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff John Shalikashvili; just yesterday  General Eisenhower\\'s son  General John Eisenhower  endorsed me; General Admiral w illiam Crown; General Tony McBeak  who ran the Air Force war so effectively for his father    all believe I would make a stronger commander in chief  And they believe it because they know I would not take my eye off of the goal: Osama bin Laden Unfortunately  he escaped in the mountains of Tora Bora  w e had him surrounded  But we didn\\'t use American forces  the best trained in the world  to go kill him  The president relied on Afghan warlords and he outsourced that job too  That\\'s wrong LEHRER: New question  two minutes  Senator Kerry \"Colossal misjudgments \" w hat colossal misjudgments  in your opinion  has President Bush made in these areas KERRY: w ell  where do you want me to begin First of all  he made the misjudgment of saying to America that he was going to build a true alliance  that he would exhaust the remedies of the United Nations and go through the inspections In fact  he first didn\\'t even want to do that  And it wasn\\'t until former Secretary of State Jim Baker and General Scowcroft and others pushed publicly and said you\\'ve got to go to the U N   that the president finally changed his mind    his campaign has a word for that    and went to the United Nations Now  once there  we could have continued those inspections w e had Saddam Hussein trapped He also promised America that he would go to war as a last resort Those words mean something to me  as somebody who has been in combat  \"Last resort \" You\\'ve got to be able to look in the eyes of families and say to those parents  \"I tried to do everything in my power to prevent the loss of your son and daughter \"I don\\'t believe the United States did that And we pushed our allies aside And so  today  we are 90 percent of the casualties and 90 percent of the cost: $200 billion    $200 billion that could have been used for health care  for schools  for construction  for prescription drugs for seniors  and it\\'s in Iraq And Iraq is not even the center of the focus of the war on terror  The center is Afghanistan  where  incidentally  there were more Americans killed last year than the year before; where the opium production is 75 percent of the world\\'s opium production; where 40 to 60 percent of the economy of Afghanistan is based on opium; where the elections have been postponed three times The president moved the troops  so he\\'s got 10 times the number of troops in Iraq than he has in Afghanistan  where Osama bin Laden is  Does that mean that Saddam Hussein was 10 times more important than Osama bin Laden    than  excuse me  Saddam Hussein more important than Osama bin Laden  I don\\'t think so LEHRER: Ninety second response  Mr  President BUSH: My opponent looked at the same intelligence I looked at and declared in 2002 that Saddam Hussein was a grave threat He also said in December of 2003 that anyone who doubts that the world is safer without Saddam Hussein does not have the judgment to be president I agree with him  The world is better off without Saddam Hussein I was hoping diplomacy would work  I understand the serious consequences of committing our troops into harm\\'s way It\\'s the hardest decision a president makes  So I went to the United Nations  I didn\\'t need anybody to tell me to go to the United Nations  I decided to go there myself And I went there hoping that  once and for all  the free world would act in concert to get Saddam Hussein to listen to our demands  They passed the resolution that said  \"Disclose  disarm  or face serious consequences \" I believe  when an international body speaks  it must mean what it says Saddam Hussein had no intention of disarming  w hy should he  He had 16 other resolutions and nothing took place  As a matter of fact  my opponent talks about inspectors  The facts are that he was systematically deceiving the inspectors That wasn\\'t going to work  That\\'s kind of a pre September 10th mentality  the hope that somehow resolutions and failed inspections would make this world a more peaceful place  He was hoping we\\'d turn away  But there was fortunately others beside myself who believed that we ought to take action w e did  The world is safer without Saddam Hussein LEHRER: New question  Mr  President  Two minutes w hat about Senator Kerry\\'s point  the comparison he drew between the priorities of going after Osama bin Laden and going after Saddam Hussein BUSH: Jim  we\\'ve got the capability of doing both As a matter of fact  this is a global effort w e\\'re facing a group of folks who have such hatred in their heart  they\\'ll strike anywhere  with any means And that\\'s why it\\'s essential that we have strong alliances  and we do That\\'s why it\\'s essential that we make sure that we keep weapons of mass destruction out of the hands of people like Al Qaida  which we are But to say that there\\'s only one focus on the war on terror doesn\\'t really understand the nature of the war on terror Of course we\\'re after Saddam Hussein    I mean bin Laden  He\\'s isolated  Seventy five percent of his people have been brought to justice  The killer    the mastermind of the September 11th attacks  Khalid Sheik Mohammed  is in prison w e\\'re making progress But the front on this war is more than just one place  The Philippines    we\\'ve got help    we\\'re helping them there to bring    to bring Al Qaida affiliates to justice there And  of course  Iraq is a central part in the war on terror  That\\'s why Zarqawi and his people are trying to fight us  Their hope is that we grow weary and we leave The biggest disaster that could happen is that we not succeed in Iraq  w e will succeed  w e\\'ve got a plan to do so  And the main reason we\\'ll succeed is because the Iraqis want to be free I had the honor of visiting with Prime Minister Allawi  He\\'s a strong  courageous leader  He believes in the freedom of the Iraqi people He doesn\\'t want U S  leadership  however  to send mixed signals  to not stand with the Iraqi people He believes  like I believe  that the Iraqis are ready to fight for their own freedom  They just need the help to be trained  There will be elections in January  w e\\'re spending reconstruction money  And our alliance is strong That\\'s the plan for victory And when Iraq if free  America will be more secure LEHRER: Senator Kerry  90 seconds KERRY: The president just talked about Iraq as a center of the war on terror  Iraq was not even close to the center of the war on terror before the president invaded it The president made the judgment to divert forces from under General Tommy Franks from Afghanistan before the Congress even approved it to begin to prepare to go to war in Iraq And he rushed the war in Iraq without a plan to win the peace  Now  that is not the judgment that a president of the United States ought to make  You don\\'t take America to war unless have the plan to win the peace  You don\\'t send troops to war without the body armor that they need I\\'ve met kids in Ohio  parents in w isconsin places  Iowa  where they\\'re going out on the Internet to get the state of the art body gear to send to their kids  Some of them got it for a birthday present I think that\\'s wrong  Humvees    10 000 out of 12 000 Humvees that are over there aren\\'t armored  And you go visit some of those kids in the hospitals today who were maimed because they don\\'t have the armament This president just    I don\\'t know if he sees what\\'s really happened over there  But it\\'s getting worse by the day  More soldiers killed in June than before  More in July than June  More in August than July  More in September than in August And now we see beheadings  And we got weapons of mass destruction crossing the border every single day  and they\\'re blowing people up  And we don\\'t have enough troops there BUSH: Can I respond to that LEHRER: Let\\'s do one of these one minute extensions  You have 30 seconds BUSH: Thank you  sir  First of all  what my opponent wants you to forget is that he voted to authorize the use of force and now says it\\'s the wrong war at the wrong time at the wrong place I don\\'t see how you can lead this country to succeed in Iraq if you say wrong war  wrong time  wrong place  w hat message does that send our troops  w hat message does that send to our allies  w hat message does that send the Iraqis No  the way to win this is to be steadfast and resolved and to follow through on the plan that I\\'ve just outlined LEHRER: Thirty seconds  Senator KERRY: Yes  we have to be steadfast and resolved  and I am  And I will succeed for those troops  now that we\\'re there  w e have to succeed  w e can\\'t leave a failed Iraq  But that doesn\\'t mean it wasn\\'t a mistake of judgment to go there and take the focus off of Osama bin Laden  It was  Now  we can succeed  But I don\\'t believe this president can  I think we need a president who has the credibility to bring the allies back to the table and to do what\\'s necessary to make it so America isn\\'t doing this alone LEHRER: w e\\'ll come back to Iraq in a moment  But I want to come back to where I began  on homeland security  This is a two minute new question  Senator Kerry As president  what would you do  specifically  in addition to or differently to increase the homeland security of the United States than what President Bush is doing KERRY: Jim  let me tell you exactly what I\\'ll do  And there are a long list of thing  First of all  what kind of mixed message does it send when you have $500 million going over to Iraq to put police officers in the streets of Iraq  and the president is cutting the COPS program in America w hat kind of message does it send to be sending money to open firehouses in Iraq  but we\\'re shutting firehouses who are the first  responders here in America The president hasn\\'t put one nickel  not one nickel into the effort to fix some of our tunnels and bridges and most exposed subway systems  That\\'s why they had to close down the subway in New York when the Republican Convention was there  w e hadn\\'t done the work that ought to be done The president    95 percent of the containers that come into the ports  right here in Florida  are not inspected  Civilians get onto aircraft  and their luggage is X rayed  but the cargo hold is not X  rayed Does that make you feel safer in America This president thought it was more important to give the wealthiest people in America a tax cut rather than invest in homeland security  Those aren\\'t my values  I believe in protecting America first And long before President Bush and I get a tax cut    and that\\'s who gets it    long before we do  I\\'m going to invest in homeland security and I\\'m going to make sure we\\'re not cutting COPS programs in America and we\\'re fully staffed in our firehouses and that we protect the nuclear and chemical plants The president also unfortunately gave in to the chemical industry  which didn\\'t want to do some of the things necessary to strengthen our chemical plant exposure And there\\'s an enormous undone job to protect the loose nuclear materials in the world that are able to get to terrorists  That\\'s a whole other subject  but I see we still have a little bit more time Let me just quickly say  at the current pace  the president will not secure the loose material in the Soviet Union    former Soviet Union for 13 years  I\\'m going to do it in four years  And we\\'re going to keep it out of the hands of terrorists LEHRER: Ninety second response  Mr  President BUSH: I don\\'t think we want to get to how he\\'s going to pay for all these promises  It\\'s like a huge tax gap  Anyway  that\\'s for another debate My administration has tripled the amount of money we\\'re spending on homeland security to $30 billion a year My administration worked with the Congress to create the Department of Homeland Security so we could better coordinate our borders and ports  w e\\'ve got 1 000 extra border patrol on the southern border; want 1 000 on the northern border  w e\\'re modernizing our borders w e spent $3 1 billion for fire and police  $3 1 billion w e\\'re doing our duty to provide the funding But the best way to protect this homeland is to stay on the offense You know  we have to be right 100 percent of the time  And the enemy only has to be right once to hurt us There\\'s a lot of good people working hard And by the way  we\\'ve also changed the culture of the FBI to have counterterrorism as its number one priority  w e\\'re communicating better  w e\\'re going to reform our intelligence services to make sure that we get the best intelligence possible The Patriot Act is vital    is vital that the Congress renew the Patriot Act which enables our law enforcement to disrupt terror cells But again  I repeat to my fellow citizens  the best way to protection is to stay on the offense LEHRER: Yes  let\\'s do a little    yes  30 seconds KERRY: The president just said the FBI had changed its culture  w e just read on the front pages of America\\'s papers that there are over 100 000 hours of tapes  unlistened to  On one of those tapes may be the enemy being right the next time And the test is not whether you\\'re spending more money  The test is  are you doing everything possible to make America safe w e didn\\'t need that tax cut  America needed to be safe BUSH: Of course we\\'re doing everything we can to protect America  I wake up every day thinking about how best to protect America  That\\'s my job I work with Director Mueller of the FBI; comes in my office when I\\'m in w ashington every morning  talking about how to protect us  There\\'s a lot of really good people working hard to do so It\\'s hard work  But  again  I want to tell the American people  we\\'re doing everything we can at home  but you better have a president who chases these terrorists down and bring them to justice before they hurt us again LEHRER: New question  Mr  President  Two minutes w hat criteria would you use to determine when to start bringing U S  troops home from Iraq BUSH: Let me first tell you that the best way for Iraq to be safe and secure is for Iraqi citizens to be trained to do the job And that\\'s what we\\'re doing  w e\\'ve got 100 000 trained now  125 000 by the end of this year  200 000 by the end of next year  That is the best way  w e\\'ll never succeed in Iraq if the Iraqi citizens do not want to take matters into their own hands to protect themselves  I believe they want to  Prime Minister Allawi believes they want to And so the best indication about when we can bring our troops home    which I really want to do  but I don\\'t want to do so for the sake of bringing them home; I want to do so because we\\'ve achieved an objective    is to see the Iraqis perform and to see the Iraqis step up and take responsibility And so  the answer to your question is: w hen our general is on the ground and Ambassador Negroponte tells me that Iraq is ready to defend herself from these terrorists  that elections will have been held by then  that their stability and that they\\'re on their way to  you know  a nation that\\'s free; that\\'s when And I hope it\\'s as soon as possible  But I know putting artificial deadlines won\\'t work  My opponent at one time said  \"w ell  get me elected  I\\'ll have them out of there in six months \" You can\\'t do that and expect to win the war on terror  My message to our troops is  \"Thank you for what you\\'re doing  w e\\'re standing with you strong  w e\\'ll give you all the equipment you need  And we\\'ll get you home as soon as the mission\\'s done  because this is a vital mission \"A free Iraq will be an ally in the war on terror  and that\\'s essential  A free Iraq will set a powerful example in the part of the world that is desperate for freedom  A free Iraq will help secure Israel  A free Iraq will enforce the hopes and aspirations of the reformers in places like Iran  A free Iraq is essential for the security of this country LEHRER: Ninety seconds  Senator Kerry KERRY: Thank you  Jim My message to the troops is also: Thank you for what they\\'re doing  but it\\'s also help is on the way  I believe those troops deserve better than what they are getting today You know  it\\'s interesting  w hen I was in a rope line just the other day  coming out here from w isconsin  a couple of young returnees were in the line  one active duty  one from the Guard  And they both looked at me and said: w e need you  You\\'ve got to help us over there Now I believe there\\'s a better way to do this  You know  the president\\'s father did not go into Iraq  into Baghdad  beyond Basra  And the reason he didn\\'t is  he said    he wrote in his book    because there was no viable exit strategy  And he said our troops would be occupiers in a bitterly hostile land That\\'s exactly where we find ourselves today  There\\'s a sense of American occupation  The only building that was guarded when the troops when into Baghdad was the oil ministry  w e didn\\'t guard the nuclear facilities w e didn\\'t guard the foreign office  where you might have found information about weapons of mass destruction  w e didn\\'t guard the borders Almost every step of the way  our troops have been left on these extraordinarily difficult missions  I know what it\\'s like to go out on one of those missions when you don\\'t know what\\'s around the corner And I believe our troops need other allies helping  I\\'m going to hold that summit  I will bring fresh credibility  a new start  and we will get the job done right LEHRER: All right  go ahead  Yes  sir BUSH: I think it\\'s worthy for a follow up LEHRER: Sure  right (CROSSTALK) LEHRER: w e can do 30 seconds each here  All right BUSH: My opponent says help is on the way  but what kind of message does it say to our troops in harm\\'s way  \"wrong war  wrong place  wrong time\"  Not a message a commander in chief gives  or this is a \"great diversion \"As well  help is on the way  but it\\'s certainly hard to tell it when he voted against the $87 billion supplemental to provide equipment for our troops  and then said he actually did vote for it before he voted against it Not what a commander in chief does when you\\'re trying to lead troops LEHRER: Senator Kerry  30 seconds KERRY: w ell  you know  when I talked about the $87 billion  I made a mistake in how I talk about the war  But the president made a mistake in invading Iraq  w hich is worse I believe that when you know something\\'s going wrong  you make it right  That\\'s what I learned in Vietnam  w hen I came back from that war I saw that it was wrong  Some people don\\'t like the fact that I stood up to say no  but I did  And that\\'s what I did with that vote  And I\\'m going to lead those troops to victory LEHRER: All right  new question  Two minutes  Senator Kerry Speaking of Vietnam  you spoke to Congress in 1971  after you came back from Vietnam  and you said  quote  \"How do you ask a man to be the last man to die for a mistake \"Are Americans now dying in Iraq for a mistake KERRY: No  and they don\\'t have to  providing we have the leadership that we put    that I\\'m offering I believe that we have to win this  The president and I have always agreed on that  And from the beginning  I did vote to give the authority  because I thought Saddam Hussein was a threat  and I did accept that intelligence But I also laid out a very strict series of things we needed to do in order to proceed from a position of strength  Then the president  in fact  promised them  He went to Cincinnati and he gave a speech in which he said  \"w e will plan carefully  w e will proceed cautiously  w e will not make war inevitable  w e will go with our allies \"He didn\\'t do any of those things  They didn\\'t do the planning  They left the planning of the State Department in the State Department desks  They avoided even the advice of their own general  General Shinsheki  the Army chief of staff  said you\\'re going to need several hundred thousand troops  Instead of listening to him  they retired him  The terrorism czar  who has worked for every president since Ronald Reagan  said  \"Invading Iraq in response to 9/11 would be like Franklin Roosevelt invading Mexico in response to Pearl Harbor \" That\\'s what we have here And what we need now is a president who understands how to bring these other countries together to recognize their stakes in this  They do have stakes in it  They\\'ve always had stakes in it The Arab countries have a stake in not having a civil war  The European countries have a stake in not having total disorder on their doorstep But this president hasn\\'t even held the kind of statesman like summits that pull people together and get them to invest in those states  In fact  he\\'s done the opposite  He pushed them away w hen the Secretary General Kofi Annan offered the United Nations  he said  \"No  no  we\\'ll go do this alone \"To save for Halliburton the spoils of the war  they actually issued a memorandum from the Defense Department saying  \"If you weren\\'t with us in the war  don\\'t bother applying for any construction \"That\\'s not a way to invite people LEHRER: Ninety seconds BUSH: That\\'s totally absurd  Of course  the U N  was invited in  And we support the U N  efforts there  They pulled out after Sergio de Mello got killed  But they\\'re now back in helping with elections My opponent says we didn\\'t have any allies in this war  w hat\\'s he say to Tony Blair  w hat\\'s he say to Alexander Kwasniewski of Poland  You can\\'t expect to build an alliance when you denigrate the contributions of those who are serving side by side with American troops in Iraq Plus  he says the cornerstone of his plan to succeed in Iraq is to call upon nations to serve  So what\\'s the message going to be: \"Please join us in Iraq  For a grand diversion  Join us for a war that is the wrong war at the wrong place at the wrong time \"I know how these people think  I deal with them all the time  I sit down with the world leaders frequently and talk to them on the phone frequently  They\\'re not going to follow somebody who says  \"This is the wrong war at the wrong place at the wrong time \"They\\'re not going to follow somebody who says this is the wrong war at the wrong place at the wrong time  They\\'re not going to follow somebody whose core convictions keep changing because of politics in America And finally  he says we ought to have a summit  w ell  there are summits being held  Japan is going to have a summit for the donors; $14 billion pledged  And Prime Minister Koizumi is going to call countries to account  to get them to contribute And there\\'s going to be an Arab summit  of the neighborhood countries  And Colin Powell helped set up that summit LEHRER: 30 seconds  Senator KERRY: The United Nations  Kofi Annan offered help after Baghdad fell  And we never picked him up on that and did what was necessary to transfer authority and to transfer reconstruction  It was always American run Secondly  when we went in  there were three countries: Great Britain  Australia and the United States  That\\'s not a grand coalition  w e can do better LEHRER: Thirty seconds  Mr  President BUSH: w ell  actually  he forgot Poland  And now there\\'s 30 nations involved  standing side by side with our American troops And I honor their sacrifices  And I don\\'t appreciate it when a candidate for president denigrates the contributions of these brave soldiers You cannot lead the world if you do not honor the contributions of those who are with us  He called them coerced and the bribed  That\\'s not how you bring people together Our coalition is strong  It will remain strong  so long as I\\'m the president LEHRER: New question  Mr  President  two minutes  You have said there was a  quote  \"miscalculation \" of what the conditions would be in post war Iraq  w hat was the miscalculation  and how did it happen BUSH: No  what I said was that  because we achieved such a rapid victory  more of the Saddam loyalists were around  I mean  we thought we\\'d whip more of them going in But because Tommy Franks did such a great job in planning the operations  we moved rapidly  and a lot of the Baathists and Saddam loyalists laid down their arms and disappeared  I thought they would stay and fight  but they didn\\'t And now we\\'re fighting them now  And it\\'s hard work  I understand how hard it is  I get the casualty reports every day  I see on the TV screens how hard it is  But it\\'s necessary work And I\\'m optimistic  See  I think you can be realistic and optimistic at the same time  I\\'m optimistic we\\'ll achieve    I know we won\\'t achieve if we send mixed signals  I know we\\'re not going to achieve our objective if we send mixed signals to our troops  our friends  the Iraqi citizens w e\\'ve got a plan in place  The plan says there will be elections in January  and there will be  The plan says we\\'ll train Iraqi soldiers so they can do the hard work  and we are And it\\'s not only just America  but NATO is now helping  Jordan\\'s helping train police  UAE is helping train police w e\\'ve allocated $7 billion over the next months for reconstruction efforts  And we\\'re making progress there And our alliance is strong  And as I just told you  there\\'s going to be a summit of the Arab nations  Japan will be hosting a summit  w e\\'re making progress It is hard work  It is hard work to go from a tyranny to a democracy  It\\'s hard work to go from a place where people get their hands cut off  or executed  to a place where people are free But it\\'s necessary work  And a free Iraq is going to make this world a more peaceful place LEHRER: Ninety seconds  Senator Kerry KERRY: w hat I think troubles a lot of people in our country is that the president has just sort of described one kind of mistake  But what he has said is that  even knowing there were no weapons of mass destruction  even knowing there was no imminent threat  even knowing there was no connection with Al Qaida  he would still have done everything the same way  Those are his words Now  I would not  So what I\\'m trying to do is just talk the truth to the American people and to the world  The truth is what good policy is based on  It\\'s what leadership is based on The president says that I\\'m denigrating these troops  I have nothing but respect for the British  Tony Blair  and for what they\\'ve been willing to do But you can\\'t tell me that when the most troops any other country has on the ground is Great Britain  with 8 300  and below that the four others are below 4 000  and below that  there isn\\'t anybody out of the hundreds  that we have a genuine coalition to get this job done You can\\'t tell me that on the day that we went into that war and it started    it was principally the United States  the America and Great Britain and one or two others  That\\'s it  And today  we are 90 percent of the casualties and 90 percent of the costs  And meanwhile  North Korea has got nuclear weapons  Talk about mixed messages  The president is the one that said  \"w e can\\'t allow countries to get nuclear weapons \" They have  I\\'ll change that LEHRER: New question  Senator Kerry  two minutes  You just    you\\'ve repeatedly accused President Bush    not here tonight  but elsewhere before    of not telling the truth about Iraq  essentially of lying to the American people about Iraq  Give us some examples of what you consider to be his not telling the truth KERRY: w ell  I\\'ve never  ever used the harshest word  as you did just then  And I try not to  I\\'ve been    but I\\'ll nevertheless tell you that I think he has not been candid with the American people  And I\\'ll tell you exactly how First of all  we all know that in his state of the union message  he told Congress about nuclear materials that didn\\'t exist w e know that he promised America that he was going to build this coalition  I just described the coalition  It is not the kind of coalition we were described when we were talking about voting for this The president said he would exhaust the remedies of the United Nations and go through that full process  He didn\\'t  He cut if off  sort of arbitrarily And we know that there were further diplomatic efforts under way  They just decided the time for diplomacy is over and rushed to war without planning for what happens afterwards Now  he misled the American people in his speech when he said we will plan carefully  They obviously didn\\'t  He misled the American people when he said we\\'d go to war as a last resort  w e did not go as a last resort  And most Americans know the difference Now  this has cost us deeply in the world  I believe that it is important to tell the truth to the American people  I\\'ve worked with those leaders the president talks about  I\\'ve worked with them for 20 years  for longer than this president  And I know what many of them say today  and I know how to bring them back to the table And I believe that a fresh start  new credibility  a president who can understand what we have to do to reach out to the Muslim world to make it clear that this is not  you know    Osama bin Laden uses the invasion of Iraq in order to go out to people and say that America has declared war on Islam w e need to be smarter about now we wage a war on terror  w e need to deny them the recruits  w e need to deny them the safe havens  w e need to rebuild our alliances I believe that Ronald Reagan  John Kennedy  and the others did that more effectively  and I\\'m going to try to follow in their footsteps LEHRER: Ninety seconds  Mr  President BUSH: My opponent just said something amazing  He said Osama bin Laden uses the invasion of Iraq as an excuse to spread hatred for America  Osama bin Laden isn\\'t going to determine how we defend ourselves Osama bin Laden doesn\\'t get to decide  The American people decide I decided the right action was in Iraq  My opponent calls it a mistake  It wasn\\'t a mistake He said I misled on Iraq  I don\\'t think he was misleading when he called Iraq a grave threat in the fall of 2002 I don\\'t think he was misleading when he said that it was right to disarm Iraq in the spring of 2003 I don\\'t think he misled you when he said that  you know  anyone who doubted whether the world was better off without Saddam Hussein in power didn\\'t have the judgment to be president  I don\\'t think he was misleading I think what is misleading is to say you can lead and succeed in Iraq if you keep changing your positions on this war  And he has  As the politics change  his positions change  And that\\'s not how a commander in chief acts Let me finish The intelligence I looked at was the same intelligence my opponent looked at  the very same intelligence  And when I stood up there and spoke to the Congress  I was speaking off the same intelligence he looked at to make his decisions to support the authorization of force LEHRER: Thirty seconds  w e\\'ll do a 30 second here KERRY: I wasn\\'t misleading when I said he was a threat  Nor was I misleading on the day that the president decided to go to war when I said that he had made a mistake in not building strong alliances and that I would have preferred that he did more diplomacy I\\'ve had one position  one consistent position  that Saddam Hussein was a threat  There was a right way to disarm him and a wrong way  And the president chose the wrong way LEHRER: Thirty seconds  Mr  President BUSH: The only thing consistent about my opponent\\'s position is that he\\'s been inconsistent  He changes positions  And you cannot change positions in this war on terror if you expect to win And I expect to win  It\\'s necessary we win w e\\'re being challenged like never before  And we have a duty to our country and to future generations of America to achieve a free Iraq  a free Afghanistan  and to rid the world of weapons of mass destruction LEHRER: New question  Mr  President  Two minutes Has the war in Iraq been worth the cost of American lives  1 052 as of today BUSH: You know  every life is precious  Every life matters  You know  my hardest    the hardest part of the job is to know that I committed the troops in harm\\'s way and then do the best I can to provide comfort for the loved ones who lost a son or a daughter or a husband or wife You know  I think about Missy Johnson  She\\'s a fantastic lady I met in Charlotte  North Carolina  She and her son Bryan  they came to see me  Her husband PJ got killed  He\\'d been in Afghanistan  went to Iraq You know  it\\'s hard work to try to love her as best as I can  knowing full well that the decision I made caused her loved one to be in harm\\'s way I told her after we prayed and teared up and laughed some that I thought her husband\\'s sacrifice was noble and worthy  Because I understand the stakes of this war on terror  I understand that we must find Al Qaida wherever they hide w e must deal with threats before they fully materialize  And Saddam Hussein was a threat  and that we must spread liberty because in the long run  the way to defeat hatred and tyranny and oppression is to spread freedom Missy understood that  That\\'s what she told me her husband understood  So you say  \"w as it worth it \" Every life is precious  That\\'s what distinguishes us from the enemy  Everybody matters  But I think it\\'s worth it  Jim I think it\\'s worth it  because I think    I know in the long term a free Iraq  a free Afghanistan  will set such a powerful example in a part of the world that\\'s desperate for freedom  It will help change the world; that we can look back and say we did our duty LEHRER: Senator  90 seconds KERRY: I understand what the president is talking about  because I know what it means to lose people in combat  And the question  is it worth the cost  reminds me of my own thinking when I came back from fighting in that war And it reminds me that it is vital for us not to confuse the war  ever  with the warriors  That happened before And that\\'s one of the reasons why I believe I can get this job done  because I am determined for those soldiers and for those families  for those kids who put their lives on the line That is noble  That\\'s the most noble thing that anybody can do  And I want to make sure the outcome honors that nobility Now  we have a choice here  I\\'ve laid out a plan by which I think we can be successful in Iraq: with a summit  by doing better training  faster  by cutting    by doing what we need to do with respect to the U N  and the elections There\\'s only 25 percent of the people in there  They can\\'t have an election right now The president\\'s not getting the job done So the choice for America is  you can have a plan that I\\'ve laid out in four points  each of which I can tell you more about or you can go to johnkerry com and see more of it; or you have the president\\'s plan  which is four words: more of the same I think my plan is better And my plan has a better chance of standing up and fighting for those troops I will never let those troops down  and will hunt and kill the terrorists wherever they are LEHRER: All right  sir  go ahead  Thirty seconds BUSH: Yes  I understand what it means to the commander in chief  And if I were to ever say  \"This is the wrong war at the wrong time at the wrong place \" the troops would wonder  how can I follow this guy You cannot lead the war on terror if you keep changing positions on the war on terror and say things like  \"w ell  this is just a grand diversion \" It\\'s not a grand diversion  This is an essential that we get it right And so  the plan he talks about simply won\\'t work LEHRER: Senator Kerry  you have 30 seconds  You have 30 seconds  right  And then the president KERRY: Secretary of State Colin Powell told this president the Pottery Barn rule: If you break it  you fix it Now  if you break it  you made a mistake  It\\'s the wrong thing to do  But you own it  And then you\\'ve got to fix it and do something with it Now that\\'s what we have to do  There\\'s no inconsistency  Soldiers know over there that this isn\\'t being done right yet  I\\'m going to get it right for those soldiers  because it\\'s important to Israel  it\\'s important to America  it\\'s important to the world  it\\'s important to the fight on terror But I have a plan to do it  He doesn\\'t LEHRER: Speaking of your plan  new question  Senator Kerry  Two minutes Can you give us specifics  in terms of a scenario  time lines  et cetera  for ending major U S  military involvement in Iraq KERRY: The time line that I\\'ve set out    and again  I want to correct the president  because he\\'s misled again this evening on what I\\'ve said  I didn\\'t say I would bring troops out in six months  I said  if we do the things that I\\'ve set out and we are successful  we could begin to draw the troops down in six months And I think a critical component of success in Iraq is being able to convince the Iraqis and the Arab world that the United States doesn\\'t have long term designs on it As I understand it  we\\'re building some 14 military bases there now  and some people say they\\'ve got a rather permanent concept to them w hen you guard the oil ministry  but you don\\'t guard the nuclear facilities  the message to a lot of people is maybe  \"w ow  maybe they\\'re interested in our oil \"Now  the problem is that they didn\\'t think these things through properly  And these are the things you have to think through w hat I want to do is change the dynamics on the ground  And you have to do that by beginning to not back off of the Fallujahs and other places  and send the wrong message to the terrorists  You have to close the borders You\\'ve got to show you\\'re serious in that regard  But you\\'ve also got to show that you are prepared to bring the rest of the world in and share the stakes I will make a flat statement: The United States of America has no long term designs on staying in Iraq And our goal in my administration would be to get all of the troops out of there with a minimal amount you need for training and logistics as we do in some other countries in the world after a war to be able to sustain the peace But that\\'s how we\\'re going to win the peace  by rapidly training the Iraqis themselves Even the administration has admitted they haven\\'t done the training  because they came back to Congress a few weeks ago and asked for a complete reprogramming of the money Now what greater admission is there  16 months afterwards  \"Oops  we haven\\'t done the job  w e have to start to spend the money now  w ill you guys give us permission to shift it over into training \"LEHRER: Ninety seconds BUSH: There are 100 000 troops trained  police  guard  special units  border patrol  There\\'s going to be 125 000 trained by the end of this year  Yes  we\\'re getting the job done  It\\'s hard work  Everybody knows it\\'s hard work  because there\\'s a determined enemy that\\'s trying to defeat us Now  my opponent says he\\'s going to try to change the dynamics on the ground  w ell  Prime Minister Allawi was here  He is the leader of that country  He\\'s a brave  brave man  w hen he came  after giving a speech to the Congress  my opponent questioned his credibility You can\\'t change the dynamics on the ground if you\\'ve criticized the brave leader of Iraq One of his campaign people alleged that Prime Minister Allawi was like a puppet  That\\'s no way to treat somebody who\\'s courageous and brave  that is trying to lead his country forward The way to make sure that we succeed is to send consistent  sound messages to the Iraqi people that when we give our word  we will keep our word  that we stand with you  that we believe you want to be free  And I do I believe that 25 million people  the vast majority  long to have elections I reject this notion    and I\\'m suggesting my opponent isn\\'t    I reject the notion that some say that if you\\'re Muslim you can\\'t free  you don\\'t desire freedom  I disagree  strongly disagree with that LEHRER: Thirty seconds KERRY: I couldn\\'t agree more that the Iraqis want to be free and that they could be free But I think the president  again  still hasn\\'t shown how he\\'s going to go about it the right way  He has more of the same Now  Prime Minister Allawi came here  and he said the terrorists are pouring over the border  That\\'s Allawi\\'s assessment The national intelligence assessment that was given to the president in July said  best case scenario  more of the same of what we see today; worst case scenario  civil war I can do better BUSH: Yes  let me   LEHRER: Yes  30 seconds BUSH: The reason why Prime Minister Allawi said they\\'re coming across the border is because he recognizes that this is a central part of the war on terror  They\\'re fighting us because they\\'re fighting freedom They understand that a free Afghanistan or a free Iraq will be a major defeat for them  And those are the stakes And that\\'s why it is essential we not leave  That\\'s why it\\'s essential we hold the line  That\\'s why it\\'s essential we win  And we will  Under my leadership we\\'re going to win this war in Iraq LEHRER: Mr  President  new question  Two minutes  Does the Iraq experience make it more likely or less likely that you would take the United States into another preemptive military action BUSH: I would hope I never have to  I understand how hard it is to commit troops  Never wanted to commit troops  w hen I was running    when we had the debate in 2000  never dreamt I\\'d be doing that But the enemy attacked us  Jim  and I have a solemn duty to protect the American people  to do everything I can to protect us I think that by speaking clearly and doing what we say and not sending mixed messages  it is less likely we\\'ll ever have to use troops But a president must always be willing to use troops  It must    as a last resort I was hopeful diplomacy would work in Iraq  It was falling apart  There was no doubt in my mind that Saddam Hussein was hoping that the world would turn a blind eye And if he had been in power  in other words  if we would have said  \"Let the inspectors work  or let\\'s  you know  hope to talk him out  Maybe an 18th resolution would work \" he would have been stronger and tougher  and the world would have been a lot worse off  There\\'s just no doubt in my mind we would rue the day  had Saddam Hussein been in power So we use diplomacy every chance we get  believe me  And I would hope to never have to use force But by speaking clearly and sending messages that we mean what we say  we\\'ve affected the world in a positive way Look at Libya  Libya was a threat  Libya is now peacefully dismantling its weapons programs Libya understood that America and others will enforce doctrine and that the world is better for it So to answer your question  I would hope we never have to  I think by acting firmly and decisively  it will mean it is less likely we have to use force LEHRER: Senator Kerry  90 seconds KERRY: Jim  the president just said something extraordinarily revealing and frankly very important in this debate  In answer to your question about Iraq and sending people into Iraq  he just said  \"The enemy attacked us \"Saddam Hussein didn\\'t attack us  Osama bin Laden attacked us  Al Qaida attacked us  And when we had Osama bin Laden cornered in the mountains of Tora Bora  1 000 of his cohorts with him in those mountains  w ith the American military forces nearby and in the field  we didn\\'t use the best trained troops in the world to go kill the world\\'s number one criminal and terrorist They outsourced the job to Afghan warlords  who only a week earlier had been on the other side fighting against us  neither of whom trusted each other That\\'s the enemy that attacked us  That\\'s the enemy that was allowed to walk out of those mountains  That\\'s the enemy that is now in 60 countries  with stronger recruits He also said Saddam Hussein would have been stronger  That is just factually incorrect  Two thirds of the country was a no fly zone when we started this war  w e would have had sanctions  w e would have had the U N  inspectors  Saddam Hussein would have been continually weakening If the president had shown the patience to go through another round of resolution  to sit down with those leaders  say  \"w hat do you need  what do you need now  how much more will it take to get you to join us \" we\\'d be in a stronger place today LEHRER: Thirty seconds BUSH: First of all  of course I know Osama bin Laden attacked us  I know that And secondly  to think that another round of resolutions would have caused Saddam Hussein to disarm  disclose  is ludicrous  in my judgment  It just shows a significant difference of opinion w e tried diplomacy  w e did our best  He was hoping to turn a blind eye  And  yes  he would have been stronger had we not dealt with him  He had the capability of making weapons  and he would have made weapons LEHRER: Thirty seconds  Senator KERRY: Thirty five to forty countries in the world had a greater capability of making weapons at the moment the president invaded than Saddam Hussein  And while he\\'s been diverted  with 9 out of 10 active duty divisions of our Army  either going to Iraq  coming back from Iraq  or getting ready to go  North Korea\\'s gotten nuclear weapons and the world is more dangerous  Iran is moving toward nuclear weapons and the world is more dangerous  Darfur has a genocide The world is more dangerous  I\\'d have made a better choice LEHRER: New question  Two minutes  Senator Kerry w hat is your position on the whole concept of preemptive war  KERRY: The president always has the right  and always has had the right  for preemptive strike  That was a great doctrine throughout the Cold w ar  And it was always one of the things we argued about with respect to arms control No president  through all of American history  has ever ceded  and nor would I  the right to preempt in any way necessary to protect the United States of America But if and when you do it  Jim  you have to do it in a way that passes the test  that passes the global test where your countrymen  your people understand fully why you\\'re doing what you\\'re doing and you can prove to the world that you did it for legitimate reasons Here we have our own secretary of state who has had to apologize to the world for the presentation he made to the United Nations I mean  we can remember when President Kennedy in the Cuban missile crisis sent his secretary of state to Paris to meet with DeGaulle  And in the middle of the discussion  to tell them about the missiles in Cuba  he said  \"Here  let me show you the photos \" And DeGaulle waved them off and said  \"No  no  no  no  The word of the president of the United States is good enough for me \"How many leaders in the world today would respond to us  as a result of what we\\'ve done  in that way  So what is at test here is the credibility of the United States of America and how we lead the world  And Iran and Iraq are now more dangerous    Iran and North Korea are now more dangerous Now  whether preemption is ultimately what has to happen  I don\\'t know yet  But I\\'ll tell you this: As president  I\\'ll never take my eye off that ball  I\\'ve been fighting for proliferation the entire time    anti proliferation the entire time I\\'ve been in the Congress  And we\\'ve watched this president actually turn away from some of the treaties that were on the table You don\\'t help yourself with other nations when you turn away from the global warming treaty  for instance  or when you refuse to deal at length with the United Nations You have to earn that respect  And I think we have a lot of earning back to do LEHRER: Ninety seconds BUSH: Let me    I\\'m not exactly sure what you mean  \"passes the global test \" you take preemptive action if you pass a global test My attitude is you take preemptive action in order to protect the American people  that you act in order to make this country secure My opponent talks about me not signing certain treaties  Let me tell you one thing I didn\\'t sign  and I think it shows the difference of our opinion    the difference of opinions  And that is  I wouldn\\'t join the International Criminal Court  This is a body based in The Hague where unaccountable judges and prosecutors can pull our troops or diplomats up for trial And I wouldn\\'t join it  And I understand that in certain capitals around the world that that wasn\\'t a popular move  But it\\'s the right move not to join a foreign court that could    where our people could be prosecuted My opponent is for joining the International Criminal Court  I just think trying to be popular  kind of  in the global sense  if it\\'s not in our best interest makes no sense  I\\'m interested in working with our nations and do a lot of it  But I\\'m not going to make decisions that I think are wrong for America LEHRER: New question  Mr  President  Do you believe that diplomacy and sanctions can resolve the nuclear problems with North Korea and Iran  Take them in any order you would like BUSH: North Korea  first  I do  Let me say    I certainly hope so  Before I was sworn in  the policy of this government was to have bilateral negotiations with North Korea And we signed an agreement with North Korea that my administration found out that was not being honored by the North Koreans And so I decided that a better way to approach the issue was to get other nations involved  just besides us  And in Crawford  Texas  Jiang Zemin and I agreed that the nuclear weapons free peninsula  Korean Peninsula  was in his interest and our interest and the world\\'s interest And so we began a new dialogue with North Korea  one that included not only the United States  but now China  And China\\'s a got a lot of influence over North Korea  some ways more than we do As well  we included South Korea  Japan and Russia  So now there are five voices speaking to Kim Jong Il  not just one And so if Kim Jong Il decides again to not honor an agreement  he\\'s not only doing injustice to America  he\\'d be doing injustice to China  as well And I think this will work  It\\'s not going to work if we open up a dialogue with Kim Jong Il  Thatâ€™s what he wants  He wants to unravel the six  party talks  or the five nation coalition that\\'s sending him a clear message On Iran  I hope we can do the same thing  continue to work with the world to convince the Iranian mullahs to abandon their nuclear ambitions w e worked very closely with the foreign ministers of France  Germany and Great Britain  who have been the folks delivering the message to the mullahs that if you expect to be part of the world of nations  get rid of your nuclear programs The IAEA is involved  There\\'s a special protocol recently been passed that allows for inspections I hope we can do it  And we\\'ve got a good strategy LEHRER: Senator Kerry  90 seconds KERRY: w ith respect to Iran  the British  French  and Germans were the ones who initiated an effort without the United States  regrettably  to begin to try to move to curb the nuclear possibilities in Iran  I believe we could have done better  I think the United States should have offered the opportunity to provide the nuclear fuel  test them  see whether or not they were actually looking for it for peaceful purposes  If they weren\\'t willing to work a deal  then we could have put sanctions together  The president did nothing w ith respect to North Korea  the real story: w e had inspectors and television cameras in the nuclear reactor in North Korea  Secretary Bill Perry negotiated that under President Clinton  And we knew where the fuel rods were  And we knew the limits on their nuclear power Colin Powell  our secretary of state  announced one day that we were going to continue the dialog of working with the North Koreans  The president reversed it publicly while the president of South Korea was here And the president of South Korea went back to South Korea bewildered and embarrassed because it went against his policy  And for two years  this administration didn\\'t talk at all to North Korea w hile they didn\\'t talk at all  the fuel rods came out  the inspectors were kicked out  the television cameras were kicked out  And today  there are four to seven nuclear weapons in the hands of North Korea That happened on this president\\'s watch Now  that  I think  is one of the most serious  sort of  reversals or mixed messages that you could possibly send LEHRER: I want to make sure    yes  sir    but in this one minute  I want to make sure that we understand    the people watching understand the differences between the two of you on this You want to continue the multinational talks  correct BUSH: Right LEHRER: And you\\'re willing to do it   KERRY: Both  I want bilateral talks which put all of the issues  from the armistice of 1952  the economic issues  the human rights issues  the artillery disposal issues  the DMZ issues and the nuclear issues on the table LEHRER: And you\\'re opposed to that  Right BUSH: The minute we have bilateral talks  the six party talks will unwind  That\\'s exactly what Kim Jong Il wants  And by the way  the breach on the agreement was not through plutonium  The breach on the agreement is highly enriched uranium  That\\'s what we caught him doing  That\\'s where he was breaking the agreement Secondly  he said    my opponent said where he worked to put sanctions on Iran    we\\'ve already sanctioned Iran  w e can\\'t sanction them any more  There are sanctions in place on Iran And finally  we were a party to the convention    to working with Germany  France and Great Britain to send their foreign ministers into Iran LEHRER: New question  two minutes Senator Kerry  you mentioned Darfur  the Darfur region of Sudan  Fifty thousand people have already died in that area  More than a million are homeless  And it\\'s been labeled an act of ongoing genocide  Yet neither one of you or anyone else connected with your campaigns or your administration that I can find has discussed the possibility of sending in troops w hy not KERRY: w ell  I\\'ll tell you exactly why not  but I first want to say something about those sanctions on Iran Only the United States put the sanctions on alone  and that\\'s exactly what I\\'m talking about In order for the sanctions to be effective  we should have been working with the British  French and Germans and other countries  And that\\'s the difference between the president and me And there  again  he sort of slid by the question Now  with respect to Darfur  yes  it is a genocide  And months ago  many of us were pressing for action I think the reason that we\\'re not saying send American troops in at this point is severalfold Number one  we can do this through the African Union  providing we give them the logistical support  Right now all the president is providing is humanitarian support  w e need to do more than that  They\\'ve got to have the logistical capacity to go in and stop the killing  And that\\'s going to require more than is on the table today I also believe that it is    one of the reasons we can\\'t do it is we\\'re overextended Ask the people in the armed forces today  w e\\'ve got Guards and Reserves who are doing double duties  w e\\'ve got a backdoor draft taking place in America today: people with stop loss programs where they\\'re told you can\\'t get out of the military; nine out of our 10 active duty divisions committed to Iraq one way or the other  either going  coming or preparing So this is the way the president has overextended the United States That\\'s why  in my plan  I add two active duty divisions to the United States Army  not for Iraq  but for our general demands across the globe  I also intend to double the number of special forces so that we can do the job we need to do with respect fighting the terrorists around the world  And if we do that  then we have the ability to be able to respond more rapidly But I\\'ll tell you this  as president  if it took American forces to some degree to coalesce the African Union  I\\'d be prepared to do it because we could never allow another Rwanda It\\'s a moral responsibility for us and the world LEHRER: Ninety seconds BUSH: Back to Iran  just for a second It was not my administration that put the sanctions on Iran  That happened long before I arrived in w ashington  D C In terms of Darfur  I agree it\\'s genocide  And Colin Powell so stated w e have committed $200 million worth of aid  w e\\'re the leading donor in the world to help the suffering people there  w e will commit more over time to help w e were very much involved at the U N  on the sanction policy of the Bashir government in the Sudan  Prior to Darfur  Ambassador Jack Danforth had been negotiating a north south agreement that we would have hoped would have brought peace to the Sudan I agree with my opponent that we shouldn\\'t be committing troops  w e ought to be working with the African Union to do so    precisely what we did in Liberia  w e helped stabilize the situation with some troops  and when the African Union came  we moved them out My hope is that the African Union moves rapidly to help save lives  And fortunately the rainy season will be ending shortly  which will make it easier to get aid there and help the long suffering people there LEHRER: New question  President Bush  Clearly  as we have heard  major policy differences between the two of you  Are there also underlying character issues that you believe  that you believe are serious enough to deny Senator Kerry the job as commander in chief of the United States BUSH: That\\'s a loaded question  w ell  first of all  I admire Senator Kerry\\'s service to our country  I admire the fact that he is a great dad  I appreciate the fact that his daughters have been so kind to my daughters in what has been a pretty hard experience for  I guess  young girls  seeing their dads out there campaigning I admire the fact that he served for 20 years in the Senate  Although I\\'m not so sure I admire the record I won\\'t hold it against him that he went to Yale  There\\'s nothing wrong with that My concerns about the senator is that  in the course of this campaign  I\\'ve been listening very carefully to what he says  and he changes positions on the war in Iraq  He changes positions on something as fundamental as what you believe in your core  in your heart of hearts  is right in Iraq You cannot lead if you send mixed messages  Mixed messages send the wrong signals to our troops  Mixed messages send the wrong signals to our allies  Mixed messages send the wrong signals to the Iraqi citizens And that\\'s my biggest concern about my opponent  I admire his service  But I just know how this world works  and that in the councils of government  there must be certainty from the U S  president Of course  we change tactics when need to  but we never change our beliefs  the strategic beliefs that are necessary to protect this country in the world LEHRER: Ninety second response  Senator KERRY: w ell  first of all  I appreciate enormously the personal comments the president just made  And I share them with him  I think only if you\\'re doing this    and he\\'s done it more than I have in terms of the presidency    can you begin to get a sense of what it means to your families  And it\\'s tough  And so I acknowledge that his daughters    I\\'ve watched them I\\'ve chuckled a few times at some of their comments (LAUGHTER)And   BUSH: I\\'m trying to put a leash on them (LAUGHTER)KERRY: w ell  I know  I\\'ve learned not to do that (LAUGHTER)And I have great respect and admiration for his wife  I think she\\'s a terrific person   BUSH: Thank you KERRY:     and a great first lady But we do have differences  I\\'m not going to talk about a difference of character  I don\\'t think that\\'s my job or my business But let me talk about something that the president just sort of finished up with  Maybe someone would call it a character trait  maybe somebody wouldn\\'t But this issue of certainty  It\\'s one thing to be certain  but you can be certain and be wrong It\\'s another to be certain and be right  or to be certain and be moving in the right direction  or be certain about a principle and then learn new facts and take those new facts and put them to use in order to change and get your policy right w hat I worry about with the president is that he\\'s not acknowledging what\\'s on the ground  he\\'s not acknowledging the realities of North Korea  he\\'s not acknowledging the truth of the science of stem cell research or of global warming and other issues And certainty sometimes can get you in trouble LEHRER: Thirty seconds BUSH: w ell  I think    listen  I fully agree that one should shift tactics  and we will  in Iraq  Our commanders have got all the flexibility to do what is necessary to succeed But what I won\\'t do is change my core values because of politics or because of pressure And it is one of the things I\\'ve learned in the w hite House  is that there\\'s enormous pressure on the president  and he cannot wilt under that pressure  Otherwise  the world won\\'t be better off LEHRER: Thirty seconds KERRY: I have no intention of wilting  I\\'ve never wilted in my life  And I\\'ve never wavered in my life I know exactly what we need to do in Iraq  and my position has been consistent: Saddam Hussein is a threat  He needed to be disarmed  w e needed to go to the U N  The president needed the authority to use force in order to be able to get him to do something  because he never did it without the threat of force But we didn\\'t need to rush to war without a plan to win the peace LEHRER: New question  two minutes  Senator Kerry If you are elected president  what will you take to that office thinking is the single most serious threat to the national security to the United States KERRY: Nuclear proliferation  Nuclear proliferation  There\\'s some 600 plus tons of unsecured material still in the former Soviet Union and Russia  At the rate that the president is currently securing it  it\\'ll take 13 years to get it I did a lot of work on this  I wrote a book about it several years ago    six  seven years ago    called \"The New w ar \" which saw the difficulties of this international criminal network  And back then  we intercepted a suitcase in a Middle Eastern country with nuclear materials in it  And the black market sale price was about $250 million Now  there are terrorists trying to get their hands on that stuff today And this president  I regret to say  has secured less nuclear material in the last two years since 9/11 than we did in the two years preceding 9/11 w e have to do this job  And to do the job  you can\\'t cut the money for it  The president actually cut the money for it  You have to put the money into it and the funding and the leadership And part of that leadership is sending the right message to places like North Korea Right now the president is spending hundreds of millions of dollars to research bunker busting nuclear weapons  The United States is pursuing a new set of nuclear weapons  It doesn\\'t make sense You talk about mixed messages  w e\\'re telling other people  \"You can\\'t have nuclear weapons \" but we\\'re pursuing a new nuclear weapon that we might even contemplate using Not this president  I\\'m going to shut that program down  and we\\'re going to make it clear to the world we\\'re serious about containing nuclear proliferation And we\\'re going to get the job of containing all of that nuclear material in Russia done in four years  And we\\'re going to build the strongest international network to prevent nuclear proliferation This is the scale of what President Kennedy set out to do with the nuclear test ban treaty  It\\'s our generation\\'s equivalent  And I intend to get it done LEHRER: Ninety seconds  Mr  President BUSH: Actually  we\\'ve increased funding for dealing with nuclear proliferation about 35 percent since I\\'ve been the president  Secondly  we\\'ve set up what\\'s called the    well  first of all  I agree with my opponent that the biggest threat facing this country is weapons of mass destruction in the hands of a terrorist network  And that\\'s why proliferation is one of the centerpieces of a multi prong strategy to make the country safer My administration started what\\'s called the Proliferation Security Initiative  Over 60 nations involved with disrupting the trans shipment of information and/or weapons of mass destruction materials And we\\'ve been effective  w e busted the A Q  Khan network  This was a proliferator out of Pakistan that was selling secrets to places like North Korea and Libya  w e convinced Libya to disarm  It\\'s a central part of dealing with weapons of mass destruction and proliferation I\\'ll tell you another way to help protect America in the long run is to continue with missile defenses  And we\\'ve got a robust research and development program that has been ongoing during my administration  w e\\'ll be implementing a missile defense system relatively quickly And that is another way to help deal with the threats that we face in the 21st century My opponent opposed the missile defenses LEHRER: Just for this one minute discussion here  just for whatever seconds it takes: So it\\'s correct to say  that if somebody is listening to this  that both of you agree  if you\\'re reelected  Mr  President  and if you are elected  the single most serious threat you believe  both of you believe  is nuclear proliferation BUSH: In the hands of a terrorist enemy KERRY: w eapons of mass destruction  nuclear proliferation But again  the test or the difference between us  the president has had four years to try to do something about it  and North Korea has got more weapons; Iran is moving towards weapons  And at his pace  it will take 13 years to secure those weapons in Russia I\\'m going to do it in four years  and I\\'m going to immediately set out to have bilateral talks with North Korea LEHRER: Your response to that BUSH: Again  I can\\'t tell you how big a mistake I think that is  to have bilateral talks with North Korea  It\\'s precisely what Kim Jong Il wants  It will cause the six party talks to evaporate  It will mean that China no longer is involved in convincing  along with us  for Kim Jong Il to get rid of his weapons  It\\'s a big mistake to do that w e must have China\\'s leverage on Kim Jong Il  besides ourselves And if you enter bilateral talks  they\\'ll be happy to walk away from the table  I don\\'t think that\\'ll work LEHRER: All right  Mr  President  this is the last question  And two minutes  It\\'s a new subject    new question  and it has to do with President Putin and Russia  Did you misjudge him or are you    do you feel that what he is doing in the name of antiterrorism by changing some democratic processes is OK BUSH: No  I don\\'t think it\\'s OK  and said so publicly  I think that there needs to be checks and balances in a democracy  and made that very clear that by consolidating power in the central government  he\\'s sending a signal to the w estern world and United States that perhaps he doesn\\'t believe in checks and balances  and I told him that I mean  he\\'s also a strong ally in the war on terror  He is    listen  they went through a horrible situation in Beslan  where these terrorists gunned down young school kids  That\\'s the nature of the enemy  by the way  That\\'s why we need to be firm and resolved in bringing them to justice That\\'s precisely what Vladimir Putin understands  as well I\\'ve got a good relation with Vladimir  And it\\'s important that we do have a good relation  because that enables me to better comment to him  and to better to discuss with him  some of the decisions he makes  I found that  in this world  that it\\'s important to establish good personal relationships with people so that when you have disagreements  you\\'re able to disagree in a way that is effective And so I\\'ve told him my opinion I look forward to discussing it more with him  as time goes on  Russia is a country in transition  Vladimir is going to have to make some hard choices  And I think it\\'s very important for the American president  as well as other w estern leaders  to remind him of the great benefits of democracy  that democracy will best help the people realize their hopes and aspirations and dreams  And I will continue working with him over the next four years LEHRER: Ninety seconds  Senator Kerry KERRY: w ell  let me just say quickly that I\\'ve had an extraordinary experience of watching up close and personal that transition in Russia  because I was there right after the transformation  And I was probably one of the first senators  along with Senator Bob Smith of New Hampshire  a former senator  to go down into the KGB underneath Treblinka Square and see reams of files with names in them It sort of brought home the transition to democracy that Russia was trying to make I regret what\\'s happened in these past months  And I think it goes beyond just the response to terror  Mr  Putin now controls all the television stations  His political opposition is being put in jail And I think it\\'s very important to the United States  obviously  to have a working relationship that is good  This is a very important country to us  w e want a partnership But we always have to stand up for democracy  As George w ill said the other day  \"Freedom on the march; not in Russia right now \"Now  I\\'d like to come back for a quick moment  if I can  to that issue about China and the talks  Because that\\'s one of the most critical issues here: North Korea Just because the president says it can\\'t be done  that you\\'d lose China  doesn\\'t mean it can\\'t be done  I mean  this is the president who said \"There were weapons of mass destruction \" said \"Mission accomplished \" said we could fight the war on the cheap    none of which were true w e could have bilateral talks with Kim Jong Il  And we can get those weapons at the same time as we get China  Because China has an interest in the outcome  too LEHRER: Thirty seconds  Mr  President BUSH: You know my opinion on North Korea  I can\\'t say it any more plainly LEHRER: w ell  but when he used the word \"truth\" again   BUSH: Pardon me LEHRER:     talking about the truth of the matter  He used the word \"truth\" again  Did that raise any hackles with you BUSH: Oh  I\\'m a pretty calm guy  I don\\'t take it personally LEHRER: OK  All right BUSH: You know  we looked at the same intelligence and came to the same conclusion: that Saddam Hussein was a grave threat And I don\\'t hold it against him that he said grave threat  I\\'m not going to go around the country saying he didn\\'t tell the truth  when he looked at the same intelligence I did KERRY: It was a threat  That\\'s not the issue  The issue is what you do about it The president said he was going to build a true coalition  exhaust the remedies of the U N  and go to war as a last resort Those words really have to mean something  And  unfortunately  he didn\\'t go to war as a last resort Now we have this incredible mess in Iraq    $200 billion  It\\'s not what the American people thought they were getting when they voted LEHRER: All right  that brings us to closing statements And  again  as determined by a coin toss  Senator Kerry  you go first  and you have two minutes KERRY: Thank you  Jim  very much Thank you very much to the university  again Thank you  Mr  President My fellow Americans  as I\\'ve said at the very beginning of this debate  both President Bush and I love this country very much  There\\'s no doubt  I think  about that But we have a different set of convictions about how we make our country stronger here at home and respected again in the world I know that for many of you sitting at home  parents of kids in Iraq  you want to know who\\'s the person who could be a commander in chief who could get your kids home and get the job done and win the peace And for all the rest of the parents in America who are wondering about their kids going to the school or anywhere else in the world  what kind of world they\\'re going to grow up in  let me look you in the eye and say to you: I defended this country as a young man in war  and I will defend it as president of the United States But I have a difference with this president  I believe when we\\'re strongest when we reach out and lead the world and build strong alliances I have a plan for Iraq  I believe we can be successful  I\\'m not talking about leaving  I\\'m talking about winning  And we need a fresh start  a new credibility  a president who can bring allies to our side I also have a plan to win the war on terror  funding homeland security  strengthening our military  cutting our finances  reaching out to the world  again building strong alliances I believe America\\'s best days are ahead of us because I believe that the future belongs to freedom  not to fear That\\'s the country that I\\'m going to fight for  And I ask you to give me the opportunity to make you proud  I ask you to give me the opportunity to lead this great nation  so that we can be stronger here at home  respected again in the world  and have responsible leadership that we deserve Thank you  And God bless America LEHRER: Mr  President  two minutes BUSH: Thank you very much tonight  Jim  Senator If America shows uncertainty or weakness in this decade  the world will drift toward tragedy  That\\'s not going to happen  so long as I\\'m your president The next four years we will continue to strengthen our homeland defenses  w e will strengthen our intelligence gathering services  w e will reform our military  The military will be an all volunteer army w e will continue to stay on the offense  w e will fight the terrorists around the world so we do not have to face them here at home w e\\'ll continue to build our alliances  I\\'ll never turn over America\\'s national security needs to leaders of other countries  as we continue to build those alliances  And we\\'ll continue to spread freedom  I believe in the transformational power of liberty  I believe that the free Iraq is in this nation\\'s interests  I believe a free Afghanistan is in this nation\\'s interest And I believe both a free Afghanistan and a free Iraq will serve as a powerful example for millions who plead in silence for liberty in the broader Middle East w e\\'ve done a lot of hard work together over the last three and a half years  w e\\'ve been challenged  and we\\'ve risen to those challenges  w e\\'ve climbed the mighty mountain  I see the valley below  and it\\'s a valley of peace By being steadfast and resolute and strong  by keeping our word  by supporting our troops  we can achieve the peace we all want I appreciate your listening tonight  I ask for your vote  And may God continue to bless our great land LEHRER: And that ends tonight\\'s debate  A reminder  the second presidential debate will be a week from tomorrow  October 8th  from w ashington University in St  Louis  Charles

       " 'October 3  2000 TranscriptOctober 3  2000The First Gore Bush Presidential DebateMODERATOR: Good evening from the Clark Athletic Center at the University of Massachusetts in Boston  I\\'m Jim Lehrer of the NewsHour on PBS  and I welcome you to the first of three 90 minute debates between the Democratic candidate for president  Vice President Al Gore and the Republican candidate  Governor George w   Bush of Texas  The debates are sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates and they will be conducted within formats and rules agreed to between the commission and the two campaigns  w e\\'ll have the candidates at podiums  No answer to a question can exceed two minutes  Rebuttal is limited to one minute  But as moderator I have the option to follow up and to extend any particular give and take another three and a half minutes  Even then  no single answer can exceed two minutes  The candidates under their rules may not question each other directly  There will be no opening statements  but each candidate may have up to two minutes for a closing statement  The questions and the subjects were chosen by me alone  I have told no one from the two campaigns  or the Commission  or anyone else involved what they are  There is a small audience in the hall tonight  They are not here to participate  only to listen  I have asked  and they have agreed  to remain silent for the next 90 minutes  Except for right now  when they will applaud as we welcome the two candidates  Governor Bush and Vice President Gore (Applause)MODERATOR: And now the first question as determined by a flip of a coin  it goes to Vice President Gore  Vice President Gore  you have questioned whether Governor Bush has the experience to be President of the United States  w hat exactly do you mean GORE: w ell  Jim  first of all  I would like to thank the sponsors of this debate and the people of Boston for hosting the debate  I would like to thank Governor Bush for participating  and I would like to say I\\'m happy to be here with Tipper and our family  I have actually not questioned Governor Bush\\'s experience  I have questioned his proposals  And here is why  I think this is a very important moment for our country  w e have achieved extraordinary prosperity  And in this election  America has to make an important choice  w ill we use our prosperity to enrich not just the few  but all of our families  I believe we have to make the right and responsible choices  If I\\'m entrusted with the presidency  here are the choices that I will make  I will balance the budget every year  I will pay down the national debt  I will put Medicare and Social Security in a lockbox and protect them  And I will cut taxes for middle class families  I believe it\\'s important to resist the temptation to squander our surplus  If we make the right choices  we can have a prosperity that endures and enriches all of our people  If I\\'m entrusted with the presidency  I will help parents and strengthen families because  you know  if we have prosperity that grows and grows  we still won\\'t be successful unless we strengthen families by  for example  ensuring that children can always go to schools that are safe  By giving parents the tools to protect their children against cultural pollution  I will make sure that we invest in our country and our families  And I mean investing in education  health care  the environment  and middle class tax cuts and retirement security  That is my agenda and that is why I think that it\\'s not just a question of experience MODERATOR: Governor Bush  one minute rebuttal BUSH: w ell  we do come from different places  I come from w est Texas  The governor is the chief executive officer  w e know how to set agendas  I think you\\'ll find the difference reflected in our budgets  I want to take one half of the surplus and dedicate it to Social Security  One quarter of the surplus for important projects  and I want to send one quarter of the surplus back to the people who pay the bills  I want everybody who pays taxes to have their tax rates cut  And that stands in contrast to my worthy opponent\\'s plan  which will increase the size of government dramatically  His plan is three times larger than President Clinton\\'s proposed plan eight years ago  It is a plan that will have 200 new programs    expanded programs and creates 20 000 new bureaucrats  It it empowers w ashington  Tonight youâ€™re going to hear that my passion and my vision is to empower Americans to be able to make decisions for themselves in their own lives MODERATOR: So I take it by your answer  then  Mr  Vice President  that in an interview recently with the \"New York Times\" when you said that you questioned whether or not Governor Bush has experience enough to be president  you were talking about strictly policy differences GORE: Yes  Jim  I said that his tax cut plan  for example  raises the question of whether it\\'s the right choice for the country  And let me give you an example of what I mean  Under Governor Bush\\'s tax cut proposal  he would spend more money on tax cuts for the wealthiest 1% than all of the new spending that he proposes for education  health care  prescription drugs and national defense all combined  Now  I think those are the wrong priorities  Now  under my proposal  for every dollar that I propose in spending for things like education and health care  I will put another dollar into middle class tax cuts  And for every dollar that I spend in those two categories  I\\'ll put $2 toward paying down the national debt  I think it\\'s very important to keep the debt going down and completely eliminate it  And I also think it\\'s very important to go to the next stage of welfare reform  Our country has cut the welfare rolls in half  I fought hard from my days in the Senate and as vice president to cut the welfare rolls and we\\'ve moved millions of people in America into good jobs  But it\\'s now time for the next stage of welfare reform  and include fathers and not only mothers MODERATOR: w e\\'re going to get a lot of those BUSH: Let me just say that obviously tonight we\\'re going to hear some phony numbers about what I think and what we ought to do  People need to know that over the next ten years it is going to be $25 trillion of revenue that comes into our treasurey and we anticipate spending $21 trillion  And my plan say why don\\'t we pass 1 3 trillion of that back to the people who pay the bills  Surely we can afford 5% of the $25 trillion that are coming into the treasury to the hard working people that pay the bills  There is a difference of opinion  My opponent thinks the government    the surplus is the government\\'s money  That\\'s not what I think  I think it\\'s the hard working people of America\\'s money and I want to share some of that money with you so you have more money to build and save and dream for your families  It\\'s a difference of opinion  It\\'s a difference between government making decisions for you and you getting more of your money to make decisions for yourself MODERATOR: Let me just follow up one quick question  w hen you hear Vice President Gore question your experience  do you read it the same way  that he\\'s talking about policy differences only BUSH: Yes  I take him for his word  Look  I fully recognize I\\'m not of w ashington  I\\'m from Texas  And he\\'s got a lot of experience  but so do I  And I\\'ve been the chief executive officer of the second biggest state in the union  I have a proud record of working with both Republicans and Democrats  which is what our nation needs  Somebody that can come to w ashington and say let\\'s forget all the finger pointing and get positive things done on Medicare  prescription drugs  Social Security  and so I take him for his word GORE: Jim  if I could just respond  I know that  The governor used the phrase phony numbers  but if you look at the plan and add the numbers up  these numbers are correct  He spends more money for tax cuts for the wealthiest 1% than all of his new spending proposals for health care  prescription drugs  education and national defense all combined  I agree that the surplus is the American people\\'s money  it\\'s your money  That\\'s why I don\\'t think we should give nearly half of it to the wealthiest 1%  because the other 99% have had an awful lot to do with building the surplus in our prosperity MODERATOR: Three and a half minutes is up  New question BUSH: I hope itâ€™s about wealthy people MODERATOR: Governor Bush  you have a question  This is a companion question to the question I asked Vice President Gore  You have questioned whether Vice President Gore has demonstrated the leadership qualities necessary to be President of the United States  w hat do you mean by that BUSH: Actually what I\\'ve said  Jim  I\\'ve said that eight years ago they campaigned on prescription drugs for seniors  And four years ago they campaigned on getting prescription drugs for seniors  And now they\\'re campaigning on getting prescription drugs for seniors  It seems like they can\\'t get it done  Now  they may blame other folks  but it\\'s time to get somebody in w ashington who is going to work with both Republicans and Democrats to get some positive things done when it comes to our seniors  And so what I\\'ve said is that there\\'s been some missed opportunities  They\\'ve had a chance  They\\'ve had a chance to form consensus  I\\'ve got a plan on Medicare  for example  that\\'s a two stage plan that says we\\'ll have immediate help for seniors and what I call immediate Helping Hand  a $48 billion program  But I also want to say to seniors  if you\\'re happy with Medicare the way it is  fine  you can stay in the program  But we\\'re going to give you additional choices like they give federal employees in the federal employee health plan  They have a variety of choices to choose  so should seniors  And my point has been  as opposed to politicizing an issue like Medicare  in other words  holding it up as an issue  hoping somebody bites it and try to clobber them over the head with it for political purposes  this year  in the year 2000  it\\'s time to get it done once and for all  That\\'s what I\\'ve been critical about the administration for  Same with Social Security  I think there was a good opportunity to bring Republicans and Democrats together to reform the Social Security system so seniors will never go without  Those on Social Security today will have their promise made  but also to give younger workers the option at their choice of being able to manage some of their own money in the private sector to make sure there\\'s a Social Security system around tomorrow  There are a lot of young workers at our rallies we go to that when they hear I\\'ll trust them at their option to be able to manage  under certain guidelines  some of their own money to get a better rate of return so that they\\'ll have a retirement plan in the future  they begin to nod their heads and they want a different attitude in w ashington MODERATOR: One minute rebuttal GORE: w ell  Jim  under my plan all seniors will get prescription drugs under Medicare  The governor has described Medicare as a government HMO  It\\'s not  and let me explain the difference  Under the Medicare prescription drug proposal I\\'m making  here is how it works  you go to your own doctor  Your doctor chooses your prescription  No HMO or insurance company can take those choices away from you  Then you go to your own pharmacy  You fill the prescription and Medicare pays half the cost  If you\\'re in a very poor family or if you have very high costs  Medicare will pay all the costs  a $25 premium  and much better benefits than you can possibly find in the private sector  Now here is the contrast  95% of all seniors would get no help whatsoever under my opponent\\'s plan for the first four or five years  Now  one thing I don\\'t understand  Jim  is why is it that the wealthiest 1% get their tax cuts the first year  but 95% of seniors have to wait four to five years before they get a single penny BUSH: I guess my answer to that is the man is running on Medi scare  Trying to frighten people in the voting booth  It\\'s just not the way I think and it\\'s not my intentions and not my plan  I want all seniors to have prescription drugs in Medicare  w e need to reform Medicare  Thereâ€™s been opportunity to do so but this administration has failed to do it  And so seniors will have not only a Medicare plan where the poor seniors will have prescription drugs paid for  but there will be a variety of options  The current system today has meant a lot for a lot of seniors  and I really appreciate the intentions of the current system as I mentioned  If you\\'re happy with the system you can stay in it  But there are a lot of procedures that haven\\'t kept up in Medicare with the current times  No prescription drug benefits  no drug therapy  no preventative medicines  no vision care  w e need to have a modern system to help seniors  and the idea of supporting a federally controlled 132 000 page document bureaucracy as being a compassionate way for seniors  and the only compassionate source of care for seniors is not my vision  I believe we ought to give seniors more options  I believe we ought to make the system work better  I know this  I know it will require a different kind of leader to go to w ashington to say to both Republicans and Democrats  let\\'s come together  You\\'ve had your chance  Vice President  you\\'ve been there for eight years and nothing has been done  My point is  is that my plan not only trusts seniors with options  my plan sets aside $3 4 trillion for Medicare over the next ten years  My plan also says it requires a new approach in w ashington  D C  It\\'s going to require somebody who can work across the partisan divide GORE: If I could respond to that  Under my plan I will put Medicare in an iron clad lockbox and prevent the money from being used for anything other than Medicare  The governor has declined to endorse that idea even though the Republican as well as Democratic leaders in Congress have endorsed it  I would be interested to see if he would say this evening he\\'ll put Medicare in a lockbox  I donâ€™t think he will because under his plan if you work out the numbers Â $100 billion comes out of Medicare just for the wealthiest 1% in the tax cut  Now here is the difference  Some people who say the word reform actually mean cuts  Under the governor\\'s plan  if you kept the same fee for service that you have now under Medicare  your premiums would go up by between 18% and 47%  and that is the study of the Congressional plan that he\\'s modeled his proposal on by the Medicare actuaries  Let me give you one quick example  There is a man here tonight named George McKinney from Milwaukee  He\\'s 70 years old  has high blood pressure  his wife has heart trouble  They have an income of $25 000 a year  They can\\'t pay for their prescription drugs and so they\\'re some of the ones that go to Canada regularly in order to get their prescription drugs  Under my plan  half of their costs would be paid right away  Under Governor Bush\\'s plan  they would get not one penny for four to five years and then they would be forced to go into an HMO or to an insurance company and ask them for coverage  but there would be no limit on the premiums or the deductibles or any of the terms and conditions BUSH: I cannot let this go by  the old style w ashington politics  of we\\'re going to scare you in the voting booth  Under my plan the man gets immediate help with prescription drugs  It\\'s called Immediate Helping Hand  Instead of squabbling and finger pointing  he gets immediate help  Let me say something MODERATOR: Your â€“[cross talk]GORE: Can I make another point  They get $25 000 a year income  that makes them ineligible BUSH: Look  this is a man who has great numbers  He talks about numbers  I\\'m beginning to think not only did he invent the Internet  but he invented the calculator  It\\'s fuzzy math  It\\'s a scaring    he\\'s trying to scare people in the voting booth  Under my tax plan that he continues to criticize  I set one third  The federal government should take no more than a third of anybody\\'s check  But I also dropped the bottom rate from 15% to 10%  Because by far the vast majority of the help goes to people at the bottom end of the economic ladder  If you\\'re a family of four in Massachusetts  making $50 000  you get a 50% cut in the federal income taxes you pay  It\\'s from $4000 to about $2000  Now  the difference in our plans is I want that $2 000 to go to you  and the vice president would like to be spending the $2 000 on your behalf MODERATOR: One quick thing  gentlemen  These are your rules  I\\'m doing my best  w e\\'re way over the three and a half minutes  I have no problems with it  Do you want to have a quick response  w e\\'re almost to five minutes on this GORE: It\\'s just clear you can go to the website and look  If you make more than $25 000 a year you don\\'t get a penny of help under the Bush prescription drug proposal for at least four to five years  and then you\\'re pushed into a Medicare    into an HMO or insurance company plan  and there\\'s no limit on the premiums or the deductibles or any of the conditions  And the insurance companies say it won\\'t work and they won\\'t offer these plans MODERATOR: Let me ask you both this and we\\'ll move on on the subject  As a practical matter  both of you want to bring prescription drugs to seniors  correct GORE: Correct BUSH: Correct GORE: The difference is I want to bring it to 100% and he wants to bring it to 5% BUSH: That\\'s totally false for him to stand up here and say that  Let me make sure the seniors hear me loud and clear  They have had their chance to get something done  I\\'m going to work with Democrats and Republicans to reform the system  All seniors will be covered  all poor seniors will have their prescription drugs paid for  and in the meantime  we\\'ll have a plan to help poor seniors and in the meantime it could be one year or two years GORE: Let me call your attention to the key word there  He said all poor seniors BUSH: w ait a minute  All seniors are covered under prescription drugs in my plan GORE: In the first year BUSH: If we can get it done in the first year  you bet  Yours is phased in in eight years GORE: It\\'s a two phase plan  For the first four years    it takes a year to pass it and for the first four years only the poor are covered  Middle class seniors like George McKinney and his wife are not covered for four to five years MODERATOR: I have an idea  If you have any more to say about this  you can say it in your closing statements and we\\'ll move on  okay  New question  Vice President Gore  How would you contrast your approach to preventing future oil price and supply problems like we have now to the approach of Governor Bush GORE: Excellent question  And here is the simple difference  My plan has not only a short term component  but also a long term component  And it focuses not only on increasing the supply  which I think we have to do  but also on working on the consumption side  Now  in the short term we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price from OPEC when they want to raise the price  And in the long term we have to give new incentives for the development of domestic resources like deep gas in the western Gulf  like stripper wells for oil  but also renewable sources of energy  And domestic sources that are cleaner and better  And I\\'m proposing a plan that will give tax credits and tax incentives for the rapid development of new kinds of cars and trucks and buses and factories and boilers and furnaces that don\\'t have as much pollution  that don\\'t burn as much energy  and that help us get out on the cutting edge of the new technologies that will create millions of new jobs  Because  when we sell these new products here  we\\'ll then be able to sell them overseas  There is a ravenous demand for them overseas  Now  another big difference is Governor Bush is proposing to open up some of our most precious environmental treasures  like the Arctic National w ildlife Refuge for the big oil companies to go in and start producing oil there  I think that is the wrong choice  It would only give us a few months\\' worth of oil and the oil wouldn\\'t start flowing for many years into the future  I don\\'t think it\\'s a fair price to pay to destroy precious parts of America\\'s environment  w e have to bet on the future and move beyond the current technologies to have a whole new generation of more efficient  cleaner  energy technology BUSH: It\\'s an issue I know a lot about  I was a small oil person for a while in west Texas  This is an administration that\\'s had no plan  And all of a sudden the results of having no plan have caught up with America  First and foremost we have to fully fund LIHEAP which is a way to help low income folks  particularly here in the east to pay for high fuel bills  Secondly  we need an active exploration program in America  The only way to become less dependent on foreign sources of crude oil is to explore at home  You bet I want to open up a small part of Alaska  w hen that field is online it will produce one million barrels a day  Today we import one million barrels from Saddam Hussein  I would rather that a million come from our own hemisphere  our own country as opposed to Saddam Hussein  I want to build more pipelines to move natural gas throughout this hemisphere  I want to develop the coal resources in America  Have clean coal technologies  w eâ€™ve got abundant supplies of energy here in America and weâ€™d better get after it  we better start exploring it or otherwise we\\'ll be in deep trouble in the future because of our dependency upon foreign sources of crude MODERATOR: So if somebody is watching tonight and listening to what the two of you just said  is it fair to say  okay  the differences between Governor Bush and Vice President Gore are as follows  You\\'re for doing something on the consumption end and you\\'re for doing something on the production end GORE: Let me clarify  I\\'m for doing something both on the supply side and production side and on the consumption side  Let me say  that I found one thing in Governor Bush\\'s answer that we certainly agree on  and that\\'s the low income heating assistance program  I commend you for supporting that  I worked to get $400 million just a couple of weeks ago  And to establish a permanent home heating oil reserve here in the northeast  Now  as for the proposals that I\\'ve worked for for renewables and conservation and efficiencies and new technologies  The fact is for the last few years in the Congress  we\\'ve faced a lot of opposition to them  They\\'ve only approved about 10% of the agenda I\\'ve helped to send up there  I think we need to get serious about this energy crisis  both in the Congress and in the w hite House  and if you entrust me with the presidency  I will tackle this problem and focus on new technologies that will make us less dependent on big oil or foreign oil MODERATOR: How would you draw the difference BUSH: w ell I would first say he should have been tackling it for the last seven years  Secondly the difference is we need to explore at home  And the vice president doesn\\'t believe in exploration in Alaska  There\\'s a lot of shut in gas that we need to be moving out of Alaska by pipeline  There\\'s an interesting issue up in the northwest as well  Do we remove dams that produce hydroelectric energy  I\\'m against removing dams in the northwest  I donâ€™t know where the vice president stands but thatâ€™s a renewable energy source of energy  w e need to keep that in line  I was in coal country in w est Virginia yesterday  There is an abundant supply of coal in America  I know we can do a better job of clean coal technologies  I\\'m going to ask the Congress for $2 billion to make sure we have the cleanest coal technologies in the world  My answer to you is in the short term we need to get after it here in America  w e need to explore our resources and we need to develop our reservoirs of domestic production  w e also need to have a hemispheric energy policy where Canada  Mexico and the United States come together  I brought this up recently with Vincent Fox the newly elected president in Mexico  he\\'s a man I know from Mexico  I talked to him about how best to expedite the exploration of natural gas in Mexico and transport it up to the United States so we become less dependent on foreign sources of crude oil  This is a major problem facing America  The administration did not deal with it  It\\'s time for a new administration to deal with the energy problem GORE: If I may just briefly  Jim  note  I found a couple of other things we agree upon  w e may not find that many this evening  so I wanted to emphasize  I strongly support new investments in clean coal technology  I made a proposal three months ago on this  And also domestic exploration yes  but not in the environmental treasures of our country  w e don\\'t have to do that  That\\'s the wrong choice  I know the oil companies have been itching to do that  but it is not the right thing for the future BUSH: No  It\\'s the right thing for the consumers  Less dependency upon foreign sources of crude is good for consumers  And we can do so in an environmentally friendly way GORE: w ell can I have the last word on this MODERATOR: New question  new subject  Governor Bush  If elected president  would you try to overturn the FDA\\'s approval last week of the abortion pill RU 486 BUSH: I don\\'t think a president can do that  I was disappointed in the ruling because I think abortions ought to be more rare in America  and I\\'m worried that that pill will create more abortions and cause more people to have abortions  This is a very important topic and it\\'s a very sensitive topic  because a lot of good people disagree on the issue  I think what the next president ought to do is to promote a culture of life in America  Life of the elderly and life of those living all across the country  Life of the unborn  As a matter of fact  I think a noble goal for this country is that every child  born or unborn  need to be protected by law and welcomed to life  I know we need to change a lot of minds before we get there in America  w hat I do believe is that we can find good  common ground on issues of parental consent or parental notification  I know we need to ban partial birth abortions  This is a place where my opponent and I have strong disagreement  I believe banning partial birth abortions would be a positive step to reducing the number of abortions in America  This is an issue that will require a new attitude  w e\\'ve been battling over abortion for a long period of time  Surely this nation can come together to promote the value of life  Surely we can fight off these laws that will encourage doctors to    to allow doctors to take the lives of our seniors  Surely we can work together to create a cultural life so some of these youngsters who feel like they can take a neighbor\\'s life with a gun will understand that that\\'s not the way America is meant to be  Surely we can find common ground to reduce the number of abortions in America  As to the drug itself  I mentioned I was disappointed  I hope the FDA took its time to make sure that American women will be safe who use this drug MODERATOR: Vice President Gore GORE: w ell  Jim  the FDA took 12 years  and I do support that decision  They determined it was medically safe for the women who use that drug  This is indeed a very important issue  First of all on the issue of partial birth or so called late term abortion  I would sign a law banning that procedure  provided that doctors have the ability to save a woman\\'s life or to act if her health is severely at risk  That\\'s not the main issue  The main issue is whether or not the Roe v  w ade decision is going to be overturned  I support a woman\\'s right to choose  My opponent does not  It is important because the next president is going to appoint three and maybe even four justices of the Supreme Court  And Governor Bush has declared to the anti choice groups that he will appoint justices in the mold of Scalia and Clarence Thomas  who are known for being the most vigorous opponents of a woman\\'s right to choose  Here is the difference  He trusts the government to order a woman to do what it thinks she ought to do  I trust women to make the decisions that affect their lives  their destinies and their bodies  And I think a woman\\'s right to choose ought to be protected and defended MODERATOR: Governor  we\\'ll go to the Supreme Court question in a moment  but make sure I understand your position on RU 486  If you\\'re elected president  not through appointments to the FDA  you won\\'t support legislation to overturn this BUSH: I don\\'t think a president can unilaterally overturn it  The FDA has made its decision MODERATOR: That means you wouldn\\'t  through appointments  to the FDA and ask them to   BUSH: I think once a decision has been made  it\\'s been made unless it\\'s proven to be unsafe to women GORE: Jim  the question you asked  if I heard you correctly  was would he support legislation to overturn it  And if I heard the statement day before yesterday  you said you would order    he said he would order his FDA appointee to review the decision  Now that sounds to me a little bit different  I just think that we ought to support the decision BUSH: I said I would make sure that women would be safe who used the drug MODERATOR: On the Supreme Court question  Should a voter assume    you\\'re pro life BUSH: I am pro life MODERATOR: Should a voter assume that all judicial appointments you make to the supreme court or any other court  federal court  will also be pro life BUSH: The voters should assume I have no litmus test on that issue or any other issue  Voters will know I\\'ll put competent judges on the bench  People who will strictly interpret the Constitution and not use the bench to write social policy  That is going to be a big difference between my opponent and me  I believe that the judges ought not to take the place of the legislative branch of government  That they\\'re appointed for life and that they ought to look at the Constitution as sacred  They shouldn\\'t misuse their bench  I don\\'t believe in liberal activist judges  I believe in strict constructionists  Those are the kind of judges I will appoint  I\\'ve named four supreme court justices in the State of Texas and would ask the people to check out their qualifications  their deliberations  They\\'re good  solid men and women who have made good  sound judgments on behalf of the people of Texas MODERATOR: w hat kind of appointments should they expect from you GORE: w e both use similar language to reach an exactly opposite outcome  I don\\'t favor a litmus test  but I know that there are ways to assess how a potential justice interprets the Constitution  And in my view  the Constitution ought to be interpreted as a document that grows with our country and our history  And I believe  for example  that there is a right of privacy in the Fourth Amendment  And when the phrase a strict constructionist is used and when the names of Scalia and Thomas are used as the benchmarks for who would be appointed  those are code words  and nobody should mistake this  for saying the governor would appoint people who would overturn Roe v  w ade  It\\'s very clear to me  I would appoint people that have a philosophy that I think would have it quite likely they would uphold Roe v  w ade MODERATOR: Is the vice president right  Is that a code word for overturning Roe v  w ade BUSH: It sounds like the vice presidentâ€™s not right very many times tonight  I just told you the criteria on which I\\'ll appoint judges  I have a record of appointing judges in the State of Texas  That\\'s what a governor gets to do  A governor gets to name supreme court judges  He also reads all kinds of things into my tax plan and into my Medicare plan  I want the viewers out there to listen to what I have to say about it MODERATOR: Reverse the question  w hat code phrases should we read by what you said about what kind of people you would appoint GORE: It would be likely that they would uphold Roe v  w ade  I do believe it\\'s wrong to use a litmus test  If you look at the history of a lower court judge\\'s rulings  you can get a pretty good idea of how they\\'ll interpret questions  A lot of questions are first impression  and these questions that have been seen many times come up in a new context and so    but  you know  this is a very important issue  Because a lot of young women in this country take this right for granted and it could be lost  It is on the ballot in this election  make no mistake about it BUSH: I\\'ll tell you what kind of judges he\\'ll put on  He\\'ll put liberal activists justices who will use their bench to subvert the legislature  that\\'s what he\\'ll do GORE: Thatâ€™s not right MODERATOR: New subject  new question  Vice President Gore  if President Milosevic of Yugoslavia refuses to accept the election results and leave office  what action  if any  should the United States take to get him out of there GORE: w ell  Milosevic has lost the election  His opponent  Kostunica  has won the election  It\\'s overwhelming  Milosevic\\'s government refuses to release the vote count  There\\'s now a general strike going on  They\\'re demonstrating  I think we should support the people of Serbia and Yugoslavia  as they call the Serbia plus Montenegro  and put pressure in every way possible to recognize the lawful outcome of the election  The people of Serbia have acted very bravely in kicking this guy out of office  Now he is trying to not release the votes and then go straight to a so called runoff election without even announcing the results of the first vote  Now  we\\'ve made it clear  along with our allies  that when Milosevic leaves  then Serbia will be able to have a more normal relationship with the rest of the world  That is a very strong incentive that we\\'ve given them to do the right thing  Bear in mind also  Milosevic has been indicted as a war criminal and he should be held accountable for his actions  Now  we have to take measured steps because the sentiment within Serbia is  for understandable reasons  against the United States because their nationalism    even if they don\\'t like Milosevic  they still have some feelings lingering from the NATO action there  So we have to be intelligent in the way we go about it  But make no mistake about it  we should do everything we can to see that the will of the Serbian people expressed in this extraordinary election is done  And I hope that he\\'ll be out of office very shortly MODERATOR: Governor Bush  one minute BUSH: w ell  I\\'m pleased with the results of the election  As the vice president is  It\\'s time for the man to go  It means that the United States must have a strong diplomatic hand with our friends in NATO  That\\'s why it\\'s important to make sure our alliances are as strong as they possibly can be to keep the pressure on Mr  Milosevic  But this will be an interesting moment for the Russians to step up and lead as well  Be a wonderful time for the Russians to step into the Balkans and convince Mr  Milosevic that it\\'s in his best interest and his country\\'s best interest to leave office  The Russians have a lot of sway in that part of the world  w e would like to see the Russians use that sway to encourage democracy to take hold  It\\'s an encouraging election  It\\'s time for the man to leave MODERATOR: w hat if he doesn\\'t leave  w hat if all the diplomatic efforts  all the pressure from all over the world and he still doesn\\'t go  Is this the kind of thing  to be specific  that you as president would consider the use of U S  military force to get him gone GORE: In this particular situation  no  Bear in mind that we have a lot of sanctions in force against Serbia right now  And the people of Serbia know that they can escape all those sanctions if this guy is turned out of power  Now  I understand what the governor has said about asking the Russians to be involved  and under some circumstances that might be a good idea  But being as they have not yet been willing to recognize Kostunica as the lawful winner of the election  I\\'m not sure it\\'s right for us to invite the president of Russia to mediate this    this dispute there because we might not like the results that comes out of that  They currently favor going forward with a runoff election  I think that\\'s the wrong thing  I think the governor\\'s instinct is not necessarily bad because we have worked with the Russians in a constructive way in Kosovo  for example  to end the conflict there  But I think we need to be very careful in the present situation before we invite the Russians to play the lead role in mediating BUSH: w ell obviously we wouldn\\'t use the Russians if they didn\\'t agree with our answer  Mr  Vice President GORE: They donâ€™t BUSH: Let me say this to you  I wouldn\\'t use force  I wouldn\\'t use force MODERATOR: You wouldn\\'t use force BUSH: No MODERATOR: w hy not BUSH: It\\'s not in our national interest to use force in this case  I would use pressure and diplomacy  There is a difference with what the president did in Kosovo which I supported and this  It\\'s up to the people in this region to take control of their country MODERATOR: New question  How would you go about as president deciding when it was in the national interest to use U S  force  generally BUSH: w ell  if it\\'s in our vital national interests  and that means whether our territory is threatened or people could be harmed  whether or not the alliances are    our defense alliances are threatened  whether or not our friends in the Middle East are threatened  That would be a time to seriously consider the use of force  Secondly  whether or not the mission was clear  w hether or not it was a clear understanding as to what the mission would be  Thirdly  whether or not we were prepared and trained to win  w hether or not our forces were of high morale and high standing and well equipped  And finally  whether or not there was an exit strategy  I would take the use of force very seriously  I would be guarded in my approach  I don\\'t think we can be all things to all people in the world  I think we\\'ve got to be very careful when we commit our troops  The vice president and I have a disagreement about the use of troops  He believes in nation building  I would be very careful about using our troops as nation builders  I believe the role of the military is to fight and win war and therefore prevent war from happening in the first place  So I would take my responsibility seriously  And it starts with making sure we rebuild our military power  Morale in today\\'s military is too low  w e\\'re having trouble meeting recruiting goals  w e met the goals this year  but in the previous years we have not met recruiting goals  Some of our troops are not well equipped  I believe we\\'re overextended in too many places  And therefore I want to rebuild the military power  It starts with a billion dollar pay raise for the men and women who wear the uniform  A billion dollars more than the president recently signed into law  It\\'s to make sure our troops are well housed and well equipped  Bonus plans to keep some of our high skilled folks in the services and a commander in chief who clearly sets the mission  The mission is to fight and win war and therefore prevent war from happening in the first place MODERATOR: Vice President Gore  one minute GORE: Let me tell you what Iâ€™ll do  First of all Â I want to make it clear  our military is the strongest  best trained  best equipped  best led fighting force in the world and in the history of the world  Nobody should have any doubt about that  least of all our adversaries or potential adversaries  If you entrust me with the presidency  I will do whatever is necessary in order to make sure our forces stay the strongest in the world  In fact  in my ten year budget proposal I\\'ve set aside more than twice as much for this purpose as Governor Bush has in his proposal  Now  I think we should be reluctant to get involved in someplace in a foreign country  But if our national security is at stake  if we have allies  if we\\'ve tried every other course  if we\\'re sure military action will succeed  and if the costs are proportionate to the benefits  we should get involved  Now  just because we don\\'t want to get involved everywhere doesn\\'t mean we should back off anywhere it comes up  I disagree with the proposal that maybe only when oil supplies are at stake that our national security is at risk  I think that there are situations like in Bosnia or Kosovo where there\\'s a genocide  where our national security is at stake there BUSH: I agree our military is the strongest in the world today  that\\'s not the question  The question is will it be the strongest in the years to come  The warning signs are real  Everywhere I go on the campaign trail I see moms and dads whose son or daughter may wear the uniform and they tell me about how discouraged their son or daughter may be  A recent poll was taken among 1 000 enlisted personnel  as well as officers  over half of whom will leave the service when their time of enlistment is up  The captains are leaving the service  There is a problem  And it\\'s going to require a new commander in chief to rebuild the military power  The other day I was honored to be flanked by Colin Powell and General Norman Schwartzkopf recently stood by me side and agreed with me  They said even if we are the strongest if we donâ€™t do something if we don\\'t have a clear vision of the military  if we don\\'t stop extending our troops all around the world and nation building missions  then we\\'re going to have a serious problem coming down the road  and I\\'m going to prevent that  I\\'m going to rebuild our military power  It\\'s one of the major priorities of my administration MODERATOR: Vice President Gore  how should the voters go about deciding which one of you is better suited to make the kinds of decisions  whether it\\'s Milosevic or whatever  in the military and foreign policy area GORE: w ell  they should look at our proposals and look at us as people and make up their own minds  w hen I was a young man  I volunteered for the Army  I served my country in Vietnam  My father was a senator who strongly opposed the Vietnam w ar  I went to college in this great city  and most of my peers felt against the war as I did  But I went anyway because I knew if I didn\\'t  somebody else in the small town of Carthage  Tennessee  would have to go in my place  I served for eight years in the House of Representatives and I served on the Intelligence Committee  specialized in looking at arms control  I served for eight years in the United States Senate and served on the Armed Services Committee  For the last eight years I\\'ve served on the National Security Council  and when the conflict came up in Bosnia  I saw a genocide in the heart of Europe with the most violent war on the continent of Europe since w orld w ar II  Look  that\\'s where w orld w ar I started in the Balkans  My uncle was a victim of poisonous gas there  Millions of Americans saw the results of that conflict  w e have to be willing to make good  sound judgments  Incidentally  I know the value of making sure our troops have the latest technology  The governor has proposed skipping the next generation of weapons  I think that\\'s a big mistake  because I think we have to stay at the cutting edge MODERATOR: Governor  how would you advise the voters to make the decision on this issue BUSH: I think you\\'ve got to look at how one has handled responsibility in office  w hether or not it\\'s    the same in domestic policy as well  w hether or not you have the capacity to convince people to follow  w hether or not one makes decisions based on sound principles or whether or not you rely upon polls and focus groups on how to decide what the course of action is  w e have too much polling and focus groups going on in w ashington today  w e need decisions made on sound principles  I\\'ve been the governor of a big state  I think one of the hallmarks of my relationship in Austin  Texas  is that I\\'ve had the capacity to work with both Republicans and Democrats  I think that\\'s an important part of leadership  I think what it means to build consensus  I\\'ve shown I know how to do so  Tonight in the audience there\\'s one elected state senator who is a Democrat  a former state wide officer who is a Democrat  a lot of Democrats who are here in the debate to    because they want to show their support that shows I know how to lead  And so the fundamental answer to your question  who can lead and who\\'s shown the ability to get things done GORE: If I could say one thing MODERATOR: w e are way over three and a half minutes  Go ahead GORE: One of the key points in foreign policy and national security policy is the need to re establish the old fashioned principle that politics ought to stop at the water\\'s edge  w hen I was in the United States Congress  I worked with former President Reagan to modernize our strategic weaponry and to pursue arms control in a responsible way  w hen I was in the United States Senate I worked with former President Bush  your father  I was one of only a few Democrats in the Senate to support the Persian Gulf w ar  I think bipartisanship is a national asset  w e have to find ways to reestablish it in foreign policy and national security policy MODERATOR: Do you have a problem with that BUSH: Yeah  w hy haven\\'t they done it in seven years MODERATOR: New subject  New question  Should the voters of this election  Vice President Gore  see this in the domestic area as a major choice between competing political philosophies GORE: Oh  absolutely  This is a very important moment in the history of our country  Look  we\\'ve got the biggest surpluses in all of American history  The key question that has to be answered in this election is will we use that prosperity wisely in a way that benefits all of our people and doesn\\'t go just to the few  Almost half of all the tax cut benefits  as I said under Governor Bush\\'s plan  go to the wealthiest 1%  I think we have to make the right and responsible choices  I think we have to invest in education  protecting the environment  health care  a prescription drug benefit that goes to all seniors  not just to the poor  under Medicare  not relying on HMOs and insurance companies  I think that we have to help parents and strengthen families by dealing with the kind of inappropriate entertainment material that families are just heart sick that their children are exposed to  I think we\\'ve got to have welfare reform taken to the next stage  I think that we have got to balance the budget every single year  pay down the national debt and  in fact  under my proposal the national debt will be completely eliminated by the year 2012  I think we need to put Medicare and Social Security in a lockbox  The governor will not put Medicare in a lockbox  I don\\'t think it should be used as a piggy bank for other programs  I think it needs to be moved out of the budget and protected  I\\'ll veto anything that takes money out of Social Security or Medicare for anything other than Social Security or Medicare  Now  the priorities are just very different  I\\'ll give you a couple of examples  For every new dollar that I propose for spending on health care  Governor Bush spends $3 for a tax cut for the wealthiest 1%  Now  for every dollar that I propose to spend on education  he spends $5 on a tax cut for the wealthiest 1%  Those are very clear differences MODERATOR: Governor  one minute BUSH: The man is practicing fuzzy math again  There\\'s differences  Under Vice President Gore\\'s plan  he is going to grow the federal government in the largest increase since Lyndon Baines Johnson in 1965  w e\\'re talking about a massive government  folks  w e\\'re talking about adding to or increasing 200 programs  20 000 new bureaucrats  Imagine how many IRS agents it is going to take to be able to figure out his targeted tax cut for the middle class that excludes 50 million Americans  There is a huge difference in this campaign  He says he\\'s going to give you tax cuts  50 million of you won\\'t receive it  He said in his speech he wants to make sure the right people get tax relief  That\\'s not the role of a president to decide right and wrong  Everybody who pays taxes ought to get tax relief  After my plan is in place  the wealthiest Americans will pay a higher percentage of taxes then they do today  the poorest of Americans  six million families  won\\'t pay any tax at all  It\\'s a huge difference  A difference between big exploding federal government that wants to think on your behalf and a plan that meets priorities and liberates working people to be able to make decisions on your own GORE: Let me just say  Jim  you haven\\'t heard the governor deny these numbers  He\\'s called them phony and fuzzy  The fact remains almost 30% of his proposed tax cut goes to    only to Americans that make more than $1 million per year  More money goes to the    can I have a rebuttal here MODERATOR: I want to see if he buys that BUSH: Let me tell you what the facts are  The facts are after my plan  the wealthiest of Americans pay more taxes of the percentage of the whole than they do today  Secondly  if you\\'re a family of four making $50 000 in Massachusetts  you get a 50% tax cut  Let me give you one example  The Strunk family in Allentown  Pennsylvania  I campaigned with them the other day  They make $51 000 combined income  they pay about $3500 in taxes  Under my plan  they get $1800 of tax relief  Under Vice President Gore\\'s plan  they get $145 of tax relief  Now you tell me who stands on the side of the fence  You ask the Strunks whose plan makes more sense  There is a difference of opinion  He would rather spend the family\\'s $1800 and I would rather the Strunks spend their own money MODERATOR: Do you see it that way Mr  Vice President GORE: No  I don\\'t  and I\\'m not going to go to calling names on his facts  I\\'m just gonna tell you what the real facts are  The analysis that he\\'s talking about leaves out more than half of the tax cuts that I have proposed  And if you just add the numbers up  he still hasn\\'t denied it  he spends more money on a tax cut for the wealthiest 1% than all his new proposals for prescription drugs  healthcare  education  and national defense combined  Now those are the wrong priorities  $665 billion over ten years for the wealthiest 1%  As I said  almost 30% of it goes to Americans that make more than $1 million per year  Every middle class family is eligible for a tax cut under my proposal  Let me give you some specific examples  I believe college tuition up to $10 000 per year ought to be tax deductible so middle class families can choose to send their children to college  I believe all senior citizens should be able to choose their own doctors and get prescription drugs from their own pharmacists with Medicare paying half the bill  I believe parents ought to be able to make more choices need more public and charter school choice to send their kids always to a safe school  w e need to make education the number one priority in our country and treat teachers like the professionals that they are  And that\\'s why I have made it a number one priority in my budget  not a tax cut for the wealthy BUSH: Let me talk about tax cuts one more time  This is a man whose plan excludes 50 million Americans GORE: Not so BUSH: Take for example the marriage penalty  If you itemize your tax return  you get no marriage penalty relief  He picks and chooses  He decides who the right people are  It\\'s a fundamental difference of opinion  I want my fellow Americans to hear one more time  w e\\'ll spend $25 trillion    we\\'ll collect $25 trillion in revenue in the next 10 years and spend $21 trillion  Surely we can send 5% back to you that pay the bills  Thereâ€™s a problem wait  I want to say something  Jim  This man has been disparaging my plan with all this w ashington fuzzy math  I want you to hear a problem weâ€™ve got here in the USA  If you\\'re a single mother making $22 000 a year and you have two children  under this tax code  for every additional dollar you make  you pay a higher marginal rate on that dollar than someone making more than $200 000 a year  and that is not right  My plan drops the rate from 15% to 10% and increases the child credit from $500 to $1 000 to make the code more fair for everybody  not just a few  not just a handful  Everybody who pays taxes ought to get some relief MODERATOR: Having cleared that up  we\\'re going to a new question  Education  Governor Bush  Both of you have promised dramatically to change    to change dramatically public education in this country  Of the public money spent on education  only 6% of that is federal money  You want to change 100% of the public education with 6% of the money  is that possible BUSH: w e can make a huge difference by saying if you receive federal money we expect you to show results  Let me give you a story about public education  if I might  It\\'s about Kipp Academy in Houston  Texas  A charter school run by some people from Teach For America  Young folks saying I\\'m going to do something good for my country  I want to teach  A guy named Michael runs the school  It is a school full of so called at risk children  It\\'s how we unfortunately label certain children  Basically it means they can\\'t learn  It\\'s a school of strong discipline and high standards  It\\'s one of the best schools in Houston  Here are the key ingredients  High expectations  strong accountabily  w hat Michael says  don\\'t put all these rules on us  just let us teach and hold us accountable for every grade  That\\'s what we do  And as a result  these mainly Hispanic youngsters are some of the best learners in Houston  Texas  That\\'s my vision for public education all around America  Many of you viewers don\\'t know  but Laura and I sent our girls to public school  They went to Austin High School  And many of the public schools are meeting the call  But  unfortunately  a lot of schools are trapping children in schools that just won\\'t teach and won\\'t change  Here is the role of the federal government  One is to change Head Start to a reading program  Two is to say if you want to access reading money  you can do so  The goal is for every single child to learn to Read  there must by K 2 diagnostic teaching tools  teacher training money  available  Three  we have to consolidate the federal programs to free districts to free the schools and encourage innovators like Michael  Let them reach out beyond the confines of the current structure to recruit teach for the children type teachers  Four  we\\'re going to say if you receive federal money  measure third  fourth  fifth  sixth  seventh and eighth grade  Show us if they are learning to read  write  add and subtract and if so there will be bonus plans  But if not  instead of continuing to subsidize failure  the money will go to    the federal money will go to the parents for public school or charter school or tutorial or Catholic school  w hat I care about is children  And so does Michael Feinberg  And you know what  It can happen in America with the right kind of leadership GORE: w e agree on a couple of things on education  I strongly support new accountability  so does Governor Bush  I strongly support local control  so does Governor Bush  I\\'m in favor of testing as a way of measuring performance  Every school and every school district  have every state test the children  I\\'ve also proposed a voluntary national test in the fourth grade and eighth grade  and a form of testing the governor has not endorsed  I think that all new teachers ought to be tested in the subjects that they teach  w e\\'ve got to recruit 100 000 new teachers  And I have budgeted for that  w e\\'ve got to reduce the class size so that the student who walks in has more one on one time with the teacher  w e ought to have universal pre school and we ought to make college tuition tax deductible  up to $10 000 a year  I would like to tell you a quick story  I got a letter today as I left Sarasota  Florida  I\\'m here with a group of 13 people from around the country who helped me prepare  w e had a great time  Two days ago we ate lunch at a restaurant  The guy that served us lunch gave me a letter today  His name is Randy Ellis  He has a 15 year old daughter named Caley  who is in Sarasota High School  Her science class was supposed to be for 24 students  She\\'s the 36th student in that classroom  They sent me a picture of her in the classroom  They can\\'t squeeze another desk in for her  so she has to stand during class  I want the federal government  consistent with local control and new accountability  to make improvement of our schools the number one priority so Caley will have a desk and can sit down in a classroom where she can learn MODERATOR: All right  So having heard the two of you  the voters have just heard the two of you  what is the difference  w hat is the choice between the two of you on education BUSH: The first is  the difference is there is no new accountability measures in Vice President Gore\\'s plan  He says he\\'s for voluntary testing  You can\\'t have voluntary testing  You must have mandatory testing  You must say that if you receive money you must show us whether or not children are learning to read and write and add and subtract  That\\'s the difference  You may claim you\\'ve got mandatory testing but you don\\'t  Mr  Vice President  That\\'s a huge difference  Testing is the cornerstone of reform  You know how I know  Because it\\'s the cornerstone of reform in the State of Texas  Republicans and Democrats came together and said what can we do to make our public education the best in the country  w e\\'ve done a long way working together to do so  The cornerstone is to have strong accountability in return for money and in return for flexibility  w e\\'re going to ask you to show us whether or not    we ask you to post the results on the Internet  w e encourage parents to take a look at the comparative results of schools  w e have a strong charter school movement that I signed the legislation to get started in the State of Texas  I believe if we find poor children trapped in schools that won\\'t teach  we need to free the parents  w e need to expand education savings accounts  Something that the vice presidentâ€™s running mate supports  There\\'s big differences  He won\\'t support freeing local districts from the strings of federal money GORE: First of all  I do have mandatory testing  I think the governor may not have heard what I said clearly  The voluntary national testing is in addition to the mandatory testing that we require of states  All schools  all school districts  students themselves  and required teacher testing  which goes a step farther than Governor Bush has been willing to go  Here are a couple of differences  though  Jim  Governor Bush is in favor of vouchers which take taxpayer money away from public schools and give them to private schools that are not accountable for how the money is used and don\\'t have to take all applicants  Now  private schools play a great role in our society  All of our children have gone to both public schools and private schools  But I don\\'t think private schools should have a right to take taxpayer money away from public schools at a time when Caley Ellis is standing in that classroom  Let me give you another example  I went to a school in Dade County  Florida where the facilities are so overcrowded the children have to eat lunch in shifts with the first shift for lunch starting at 9:30 in the morning  Look  this is a funding crisis all around the country  There are fewer parents of school age children as a percentage of the voting population and there is the largest generation of students ever  w e\\'re in an information age when learning is more important than ever  90% of our kids go to public schools  w e have to make it the number one priority  Modernize our schools  reduce class size  recruit new teachers  give every child a chance to learn with one on one time in a quality    high quality  safe school  If it\\'s a failing school  shut it down and reopen it under a new principal with a turnaround team of specialists the way Governor Jim Hunt does in North Carolina  Here is another difference  The governor  if it\\'s a failing school  would leave the children in that failing school for three years and then give a little bit of money to the parents  a down payment on a down payment for private school tuition  and pretend that that would be enough for them to go out and go to a private school  It\\'s an illusion MODERATOR: w ait a minute  Governor BUSH: Okay  First of all  most of good governance is at the state level  See  here is the mentality  I\\'m going to make the state do this and make the state do that  All I\\'m saying is if you spend money  show us results and test every year  which you do not do  Mr  Vice President  You don\\'t test every year  You can say you do to the cameras but you don\\'t  unless you\\'ve changed your plan here on the stage GORE: I didn\\'t say that BUSH: You need to test every year  That\\'s how you determine if children are progressing to excellence  Secondly  one of the things that we have to be careful about in politics is throwing money at a system that has not yet been reformed  More money is needed and I spend more money  but step one is to make sure we reform the system to have the system in place that leaves no child behind  Stop this business about asking gosh  how old are you  If you\\'re 10 we\\'ll put you here  12 you put here  Start asking the question  what do you know  If you don\\'t know what you\\'re supposed to know  we\\'ll make sure you do early before it\\'s too late MODERATOR: New question  w e\\'ve been talking about a lot of specific issues  It\\'s often said that in the final analysis about 90% of being the President of the United States is dealing with the unexpected  not with issues that came up in the campaign  Vice President Gore  can you point to a decision  an action you have taken  that illustrates your ability to handle the unexpected  the crisis under fire GORE: w hen the action in Kosovo was dragging on and we were searching for a solution to the problem  our country had defeated the adversary on the battlefield without a single American life being lost in combat  But the dictator Milosevic was hanging on  I invited the former prime minister of Russia to my house and took a risk in asking him to get personally involved  along with the head of Finland  to go to Belgrade and to take a set of proposals from the United States that would constitute basically a surrender by Serbia  But it was a calculated risk that paid off  Now  I could probably give you some other examples of decisions over the last 24 years  I have been in public service for 24 years  Jim  And throughout all that time the people I have fought for have been the middle class families  and I have been willing to stand up to powerful interests like the big insurance companies  the drug companies  the HMOs  the oil companies  They have good people and they play constructive roles sometimes  but sometimes they get too much power  I cast my lot with the people even when it means that you have to stand up to some powerful interests who are trying to turn the    the policies and the laws to their advantage  You can see it in this campaign  The big drug companies support Governor Bush\\'s prescription drug proposal  They oppose mine because they don\\'t want to get Medicare involved because they\\'re afraid that Medicare will negotiate lower prices for seniors who currently pay the highest prices of all MODERATOR: Governor Bush BUSH: I\\'ve been standing up to big Hollywood  big trial lawyers  w as â€“ what was the question  It was about emergencies  wasn\\'t it MODERATOR: It was about    okay BUSH: You know  as governor  one of the things you have to deal with is catastrophe  I can remember the fires that swept Parker County  Texas  I remember the floods that swept our state  I remember going down to Del Rio  Texas  I have to pay the administration a compliment  James Lee w itt of FEMA has done a really good job of working with governors during times of crisis  But that\\'s the time when you\\'re tested not only    it\\'s the time to test your mettle  a time to test your heart when you see people whose lives have been turned upside down  It broke my heart to go to the flood scene in Del Rio where a fellow and his family got completely uprooted  The only thing I knew to do was to get aid as quickly as possible with state and federal help  and to put my arms around the man and his family and cry with them  That\\'s what governors do  They are often on the front line of catastrophic situations MODERATOR: New question  There can be all kinds of crises  Governor  A questions for you  There could be a crisis  for instance  in the financial area  the stock market could take a tumble  there could be a failure of a major financial institution  w hat is your general attitude toward government intervention in such events BUSH: w ell  it depends  obviously  But what I would do first and foremost  is I would get in touch with the Federal Reserve Chairman  Alan Greenspan  to find out all the facts and all the circumstances  I would have my Secretary of the Treasury be in touch with the financial centers not only here  but at home  I would make sure that key members of Congress were called in to discuss the gravity of the situation  And I would come up with a game plan to deal with it  That\\'s what governors end up doing  w e end up being problem solvers  w e come up with practical  common sense solutions for problems that we\\'re confronted with  In this case  in the case of a financial crisis  I would gather all the facts before I made the decision as to what the government ought or ought not to do MODERATOR: Vice President Gore GORE: First I want to compliment the governor on his response to those fires and floods in Texas  I accompanied James Lee w itt down to Texas when those fires broke out  And FEMA has been a major flagship project of our reinventing government efforts  And I agree  it works extremely well now  On the international financial crises that come up  my friend  Bob Rubin  the former Secretary of Treasury is here  he\\'s a close advisor to me and great friend in all respects  I have had a chance to work with him and Alan Greenspan and others on the crisis following the collapse of the Mexican peso  w hen the Asian financial crisis raised the risk of world wide recession that could affect our economy  And now  of course  the euro\\'s value has been dropping  but seems to be under control  But it started for me in the last eight years when I had the honor of casting the tie breaking vote to end the old economic plan here at home and put into place a new economic plan that has helped us to make some progress  22 million new jobs  the greatest prosperity ever  But it\\'s not good enough  My attitude is you ain\\'t seen nothing yet  w e need to do more and better MODERATOR: So  Governor  would you agree there is no basic difference here on intervening    on federal government intervening in what might be seen by others to be a private financial crisis BUSH: No  there\\'s no difference on that  There is a difference  though  as to what the economy has meant  I think the economy has meant more for the Gore and Clinton folks than the Gore and Clinton folks have meant for the economy  I think most of the economic growth that has taken place is a result of ingenuity and hard work and entrepreneurship and that\\'s the role of goverment to encourage that  In terms of in response to the question  no GORE: Can I comment on that MODERATOR: You may GORE: You know  I think the American people deserve credit for the great economy that we have  It\\'s their ingenuity  I agree with that  But you know  they were working pretty hard eight years ago  And now they had ingenuity eight years ago  The difference is we\\'ve got a new policy  And instead of concentrating on tax cuts mostly for the wealthy  we want    I want tax cuts for the middle class families and I want to continue the prosperity and make sure that it enriches not just a few but all of our families  w e have gone from the biggest deficits to the biggest surpluses  w e have gone from a triple dip recession during the previous 12 years to a tripling of the stock market  Instead of a high unemployment  we have the lowest African American and Latin American unemployment rates in history and 22 million new jobs  It\\'s not good enough  Too many people have been left behind  w e have got to do much more  The key is job training  education  investments in health care and education  environment  retirement security  And incidentally  we have got to preserve Social Security  I\\'m totally opposed to diverting one out of every six dollars out of the Social Security trust fund  as the Governor has proposed  into the stock market  I want new incentives for savings and investment for the young couples who are working hard so they can save and invest on their own on top of Social Security  not at the expense of Social Security  as the governor proposes BUSH: Two points  One  a lot of folks are still waiting for that 1992 middle class tax cut  I remember the vice president saying  \"Just give us a chance to get up there  we\\'re going to make sure you get tax cuts \" It didn\\'t happen  Now he\\'s having to say that again  They\\'ve had their chance to deliver a tax cut to you  Secondly  the surest way to bust this economy is to increase the role and size of the federal budget  The Senate Budget Committee did a study of the vice president\\'s expenditures  It\\'s been projected that they could conceivably bust the budget by $900 billion  That means he\\'ll either have to raise your taxes by $900 billion or go into the Social Security surplus for $900 billion  This is a plan that is going to increase the bureaucracy by 20 000 people  His targeted tax cut is so detailed  so much fine print that it is going to require numerous IRS agents  w e need somebody to simplify the code  to be fair  to continue prosperity by sharing some of the surplus with the people who pay the bills  particularly those at the bottom end of the economic ladder GORE: If I could respond  Jim  w hat he\\'s quoting is not the Senate Budget Commiitte  it is a partisan press release by the Republicans on the Senate Budget Committee that\\'s not worth the government    the taxpayer paid paper that it\\'s printed on  Now  as for 20 000 new bureaucrats  as you call them  you know  the size of the federal government will go down in a Gore administration  In the reinventing government program you just look at the numbers  It is 300 000 people smaller today than it was eight years ago  Now  the fact is you\\'re going to have a hard time convincing folks that we were a whole lot better off eight years ago than we are today  But that\\'s not the question  The question is  will we be better off four years from now than we are today  And as for the surest way to threaten our prosperity  having a $1 9 trillion tax cut  almost half of which goes to the wealthy  and a $1 trillion Social Security privatization proposal is the surest way to put our budget into deficit â€“ raise interest rates and put our prosperity at risk BUSH: I can\\'t let the man continue with fuzzy math  It is 1 3 trillion Mr  Vice President  It will go to everybody who pays taxes  I\\'m not going to be the kind of president that says you get tax relief and you don\\'t  I\\'m not going to be a picker and chooser  w hat is fair is everybody who pays taxes ought to get relief MODERATOR: I thought we cleared this up a while ago  New question on Social Security  Both of you have Social Security reform plans  so we could spend the rest of the evening and two or three other evenings talking about them in detail  w e won\\'t do that  But   GORE: Suits me MODERATOR: Many experts  including Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan  Vice President Gore  say that it will be impossible for either of you  essentially  to keep the system viable on its own during the coming baby boomer retirement onslaught without either reducing benefits or increasing taxes  You disagree GORE: I do disagree  Because if we can keep our prosperity going  if we can continue balancing the budget and paying down the debt  then the strong economy keeps generating surpluses  Here is my plan  I will keep Social Security in a lockbox and that pays down the national debt  And the interest savings I would put right back into Social Security  That extends the life of Social Security for 55 years  Now  I think that it\\'s very important to understand that cutting benefits under Social Security means that people like w inifred Skinner from Des Moines  Iowa  who is here  would really have a much harder time  Because there are millions of seniors who are living almost hand to mouth  And you talk about cutting benefits  I don\\'t go along with it  I am opposed to it  I\\'m also opposed to a plan that diverts 1 out of every $6 away from the Social Security Trust Fund  Social Security is a trust fund that pays the checks this year with the money that is paid into Social Security this year  The governor wants to divert 1 out of every $6 off into the stock market  which means that he would drain a trillion dollars out of the Social Security Trust Fund in this generation over the next ten years  and Social Security under that approach would go bankrupt within this generation  His leading advisor on this plan actually said that would be okay  because then the Social Security Trust Fund could start borrowing  It would borrow up to $3 trillion  Now  Social Security has never done that  And I don\\'t think it should do that  I think it should stay in a lockbox  and I\\'ll tell you this  I will veto anything that takes money out of Social Security for privatization or anything else other than Social Security BUSH: I thought it was interesting that on the two minutes he spent about a million and a half on my plan  which means he doesn\\'t want you to know what he\\'s doing is loading up IOUs for future generations  He puts no real assets into the Social Security system  The revenues exceed the expenses in Social Security until the year 2015 which means all retirees are going to get the promises made  For those of you who he wants to scare into the voting booth to vote for him  hear me loud and clear  A promise made will be a promise kept  You bet we want to allow younger workers to take some of their own money  That\\'s the difference of opinion  The vice president thinks it\\'s the government\\'s money  The payroll taxes are your money  You ought to put it in prudent  safe investments so that $1 trillion over the next ten years grows to be $3 trillion  The money stays within the Social Security system  It\\'s a part of the Social Security system  He claims it will be out of Social Security  It\\'s your money  it\\'s a part of your retirement benefit  It\\'s a fundamental difference between what we believe  I want you to have your own asset that you can call your own  That you can pass on from one generation to the next  I want to get a better rate of return for your own money than the paltry 2% that the current Social Security Trust gets today  Mr  Greenspan I thought missed an opportunity to say there\\'s a third way  and that is to get a better rate of return on the Social Security monies coming into the trust  There is $2 3 trillion of surplus that we can use to make sure that younger workers have a Social Security plan in the future  If we\\'re smart and if we trust workers and if we understand the power of the compounding rate of interest GORE: Here is the difference  I give a new incentive for younger workers to save their own money and invest their own money  but not at the expense of Social Security  on top of Social Security  My plan is Social Security plus  The governor\\'s plan is Social Security minus  Your future benefits would be cut by the amount that\\'s diverted into the stock market  If you make bad investments  that\\'s too bad  But even before then the problem hits because the money contributed to Social Security this year is an entitlement  That\\'s how it works  And the money is used to pay the benefits for seniors this year  If you cut the amount going in 1 out of every $6  then you have to cut the value of each check by 1 out of every $6 unless you come up with the money from somewhere else  I would like to know from the governor    I know we\\'re not supposed to ask each other questions    but I\\'d be interested in knowing  does that trillion dollars come from the trust fund  or does it come from the rest of the budget BUSH: No  There\\'s enough money to pay seniors today in the current affairs of Social Security  The trillion comes from the surplus  Surplus is money    more money than needed  Let me tell you what your plan is  It\\'s not Social Security plus  it\\'s Social Security plus huge debt  That is what it is  You leave future generations with tremendous IOUs  It\\'s time to have a leader that doesn\\'t put off tomorrow what we should do today  It\\'s time to have somebody to step up and say look  let\\'s let younger workers take some of their own money and under certain guidelines invest it in the private markets  The safest of federal investments yields 4%  That\\'s twice the amount of rate of return than the current Social Security Trust  It\\'s a fundamental difference of opinion here  folks  Younger worker after younger worker hears my call that says I trust you  And you know what  the issue is changing  Seniors now understand that the promise made will be a promise kept  but younger workers now understand we better have a government that trusts them and that\\'s exactly what I\\'m going to do GORE: Could I respond to that  Jim  This is a big issue  Could we do another round on it MODERATOR: w e\\'re almost out of time GORE: Just briefly  w hen FDR established Social Security  they didn\\'t call them IOUs  they called it the full faith and credit of the United States  If you don\\'t have trust in that  I do  If you take it out of the surplus in the trust fund  that means the trust fund goes bankrupt in this generation within 20 years BUSH: This is a government that thinks a 2% rate of return on your money is satisfactory  It\\'s not  This is a government that says younger workers can\\'t possibly have their own assets  w e need to think differently about the issue  w e need to make sure our seniors get the promise made  If we don\\'t trust younger workers to manage some of their own money with the Social Security surplus  to grow from $1 trillion to $3 trillion  it will be impossible to bridge the gap without it  w hat Mr  Gore\\'s plan will do causing huge payroll taxes or major benefit reductions MODERATOR: New question  Are there issues of character that distinguish you from Vice President Gore BUSH: The man loves his wife and I appreciate that a lot  And I love mine  The man loves his family a lot  and I appreciate that  because I love my family  I think the thing that discouraged me about the vice president was uttering those famous words  \"No controlling legal authority \" I felt like there needed to be a better sense of responsibility of what was going on in the w hite House  I believe that    I believe they\\'ve moved that sign  \"The buck stops here\" from the Oval Office desk to \"The buck stops here\" on the Lincoln bedroom  It\\'s not good for the country and it\\'s not right  w e need to have a new look about how we conduct ourselves in office  There\\'s a huge trust  I see it all the time when people come up to me and say  I don\\'t want you to let me down again  And we can do better than the past administration has done  It\\'s time for a fresh start  It\\'s time for a new look  It\\'s time for a fresh start after a season of cynicism  And so I don\\'t know the man well  but I\\'ve been disappointed about how he and his administration have conducted the fundraising affairs  You know  going to a Buddhist temple and then claiming it wasn\\'t a fundraiser isn\\'t my view of responsibility MODERATOR: Vice President Gore GORE: I think we ought to attack our country\\'s problems  not attack each other  I want to spend my time making this country even better than it is  not trying to make you out to be a bad person  You may want to focus on scandal  I want to focus on results  As I said a couple of months ago  I stand here as my own man and I want you to see me for who I really am  Tipper and I have been married for 30 years  w e became grandparents a year and a half ago  w e\\'ve got four children  I have devoted 24 years of my life to public service and I\\'ve said this before and I\\'ll say it again  if you entrust me with the presidency  I may not be the most exciting politician  but I will work hard for you every day  I will fight for middle class families and working men and women and I will never let you down MODERATOR: So  Governor  what are you saying when you mention the fundraising scandals or the fundraising charges that involve Vice President Gore  w hat are you saying that the voters should take from that that\\'s relevant to this election BUSH: They ought to factor in it when they go to the voting booth MODERATOR: In what way BUSH: I think people need to be held responsible for the actions they take in life  I think that    well  I think that\\'s part of the need for a cultural change  w e need to say we each need to be responsible for what we do  People in the highest office of the land must be responsible for decisions they make in life  And that\\'s the way I\\'ve conducted myself as Governor of Texas and that\\'s the way I\\'ll conduct myself as President of the United States  should I be fortunate enough to earn your vote MODERATOR: Are you saying all this is irrelevant  Vice President Gore GORE: No  I think the American people should take into account who we are as individuals  what our experience is  what our positions are on the issues and proposals are  I\\'m asking you to see me for who I really am  I\\'m offering you my own vision  my own experience  my own proposals  And incidentally  one of them is this  This current campaign financing system has not reflected credit on anybody in either party  And that\\'s one of the reasons I\\'ve said before  and I\\'ll pledge here tonight  if I\\'m president  the very first bill that Joe Lieberman and I will send to the United States Congress is the McCain Feingold campaign finance reform bill  And the reason it\\'s that important is that all of the other issues  whether prescription drugs for all seniors that are opposed by the drug companies or the patient\\'s bill of rights to take the decisions away from the HMOs and give them to the doctors and nurses  opposed by the HMOs and insurance companies  all these other proposals are going to be a lot easier to get passed for the American people if we limit the influence of special interest money and give democracy back to the American people  And I wish Governor Bush would join me this evening in endorsing the McCain Feingold Campaign Finance Reform Bill BUSH: You know  this man has no credibility on the issue  As a matter of fact  I read in the \"New York Times\" where he said he co sponsored the McCain Feingold Campaign Fundraising Bill  But he wasn\\'t in the Senate with Senator Feingold  And so  look  I\\'m going to    what you need to know about me is I will uphold the law  I\\'m going to have an attorney general that enforces the law  The time for campaign funding reform is after the election  This man has outspent me and the special interests are outspending me  And I am not going to lay down my arms in the middle of the campaign for somebody who has got no credibility on the issue MODERATOR: Senator McCain    hold on one second  Senator McCain said in August  \"It doesn\\'t matter which one of you is President of the United States in January  there is going to be blood on the floor of the United States Senate \" and he\\'ll tie up the Senate until campaign finance reform is passed that includes a ban on soft money  First of all  would you support that effort by him  or would you sign a bill that is finally passed that included   BUSH: I would support an effort to ban corporate soft money and labor union soft money so long as there was dues check off  I\\'ve campaigned on this since the primaries  I believe there needs to be instant disclosure on the Internet as to who has given to who  I think we need to fully enforce the law  I think we need to have an attorney general that says if a law is broken  we\\'ll enforce it  Be strict and firm about it GORE: Look  Governor Bush  you have attacked my character and credibility and I am not going to respond in kind  I think we ought to focus on the problems and not attack each other  One of the serious problems  hear me well  is that our system of government is being undermined by too much influence coming from special interest money  w e have to get a handle on it  And like John McCain  I have learned from experience  and it\\'s not a new position for me  24 years ago I supported full public financing of all federal elections  And anybody who thinks I\\'m just saying it  it will be the first bill I send to the Congress  I want you to know I care passionately about this and I will fight until it becomes law BUSH: I want people to hear what he just said  He is for full public financing of Congressional elections  I\\'m absolutely  adamently opposed to that  I don\\'t want the government financing congressional elections MODERATOR: On that wonderful note of disagreement  we have to stop here and we want to go now to your closing statements  Governor Bush is first  You have two minutes BUSH: Thank you  Jim  Thank the University of Massachusetts and Mr  Vice President  thank you  It has been a good  lively exchange  There is a huge difference of opinion  Mine is I want to empower people in their own lives  I also want to go to w ashington to get some positive things done  It is going to require a new spirit  A spirit of cooperation  It will require the ability of a Republican president to reach out across the partisan divide and to say to Democrats  let\\'s come together to do what is right for America  It\\'s been my record as Governor of Texas  it will be how I conduct myself if I\\'m fortunate enough to earn your vote as President of the United States  I want to finally get something done on Medicare  I want to make sure prescription drugs are available for all seniors  And I want seniors to have additional choices when it comes to choosing their health care plans  I want to finally get something done on Social Security  I want to make sure the seniors have the promise made will be a promise kept  but I want younger workers to be able to manage some of their own money  some of their own payroll taxes in the private sector under certain guidelines to get a better rate of return on your own money  I want to rebuild our military to keep the peace  I want to have a strong hand when it comes to the United States in world affairs  I don\\'t want to try to put our troops in all places at all times  I don\\'t want to be the world\\'s policeman  I want to be the world\\'s peacemaker by having a military of high morale and a military that is well equipped  I want anti ballistic missile systems to protect ourselves and our allies from a rogue nation that may try to hold us hostage or blackmail our allies and friends  I want to make sure the education system fulfills its hope and promise  I\\'ve had a strong record of working with Democrats and Republicans in Texas to make sure no child is left behind  I understand the limited role of the federal government  but it could be a constructive role when it comes to reform  by insisting that there be a strong accountability systems  My intentions are to earn your vote and earn your confidence  I\\'m asking for your vote  I want you to be on my team  And for those of you working  thanks from the bottom of my heart  For those of you making up your mind  I would be honored to have your support MODERATOR: Vice President Gore  two minutes GORE: I want to thank everybody who watched and listened tonight because this is indeed a crucial time in American history  w e\\'re at a fork in the road  w e have this incredible prosperity  but a lot of people have been left behind  And we have a very important decision to make  w ill we use the prosperity to enrich all of our families and not just a few  One important way of looking at this is to ask who are you going to fight for  Throughout my career in public service  I have fought for the working men and women of this country  middle class families  w hy  Because you are the ones who have the hardest time paying taxes  the hardest time making ends meet  You are the ones who are making car payments and mortgage payments and doing right by your kids  And a lot of times there are powerful forces that are against you  Make no mistake about it  they do have undue influence in w ashington  D C  and it makes a difference if you have a president who will fight for you  I know one thing about the position of president  it\\'s the only position in our Constitution that is filled by an individual who is given the responsibility to fight not just for one state or one district or the well connected or wealthy  but to fight for all of the people  including especially those who most need somebody who will stand up and take on whatever powerful forces might stand in the way  There is a woman named w inifred Skinner here tonight from Iowa  I mentioned her earlier  She\\'s 79 years old  She has Social Security  I\\'m not going to cut her benefits or support any proposal that would  She gets a small pension  but in order to pay for her prescription drug benefits  she has to go out seven days a week several hours a day picking up cans  She came all the way from Iowa in a w innebago with her poodle in order attend here tonight  I want to tell her  I\\'ll fight for a prescription drug benefit for all seniors and fight for the people of this country for a prosperity that benefits all MODERATOR: w e will continue this dialogue next week on October 11th at w ake Forest University in w inston Salem  North Carolina  The format then will be more informal  more conversational with the two candidates seated at a table with me  The third will be October 17th at w ashington University in St  Louis  and that will follow a town hall type format  Also on the day after tomorrow  October 5  there is a 90 minute debate between the democratic nominee for vice president  Senator Joe Lieberman and the republican candidate for vice president former Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney  It will be held at Centre College in Danville  Kentucky  The moderator will be Bernard Shaw of CNN  Thank you  Governor Bush  Vice President Gore  See you next week  For now from Boston  I\\'m Jim Lehrer  Thank you  and good night (APPLAUSE)',\n",
       " \"October 6  1996 Debate TranscriptOctober 6  1996The First Clinton Dole Presidential DebateLEHRER: Good evening from the Bushnell Theatre in Hartford  Connecticut  I'm Jim Lehrer of the News Hour on PBS  w elcome to the first of the 1996 Presidential debates between President Bill Clinton  the Democratic nominee  and Senator Bob Dole  the Republican nominee  This event is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates  It will last 90 minutes following a format and rules worked out by the two campaigns There will be two minute opening and closing statements  In between  a series of questions  each having three parts  A 90 second answer  a 60 second rebuttal  and a 30 second response  I will assist the candidates in adhering to those time limits with the help of a series of lights visible to both Under their rules  the candidates are not allowed to question each other directly  I will ask the questions  There are no limitations on the subjects The order for everything tonight was determined by coin toss  Now  to the opening statements and to President Clinton  Mr  President CLINTON: Thank you  Jim  And thank you to the people of Hartford  our hosts I want to begin by saying again how much I respect Senator Dole and his record of public service and how hard I will try to make this campaign and this debate one of ideas  not insults Four years ago I ran for president at a time of high unemployment and rising frustration  I wanted to turn this country around with a program of opportunity for all  responsibility from all  and an American community where everybody has a role to play  I wanted a government that was smaller and less bureaucratic to help people make the most of their own lives  Four years ago you took me on faith  Now there's a record: Ten and a half million more jobs  rising incomes  falling crime rates and welfare rolls  a strong America at peace w e are better off than we were four years ago  Let's keep it going  w e cut the deficit by 60 percent  Now  let's balance the budget and protect Medicare  Medicaid  education and the environment  w e cut taxes for 15 million working Americans  Now let's pass the tax cuts for education and child rearing  help with medical emergencies  and buying a home w e passed family and medical leave  Now let's expand it so more people can succeed as parents and in the work force  w e passed 100 000 police  the assault weapons ban  the Brady Bill  Now let's keep going by finishing the work of putting the police on the street and tackling juvenile gangs w e passed welfare reform  Now let's move a million people from welfare to work  And most important  let's make education our highest priority so that every eight year old will be able to read  every 12 year old can log onto the Internet  every 18 year old can go to college  w e can build that bridge to the 21st Century  And I look forward to discussing exactly how we're going to do it LEHRER: Senator Dole  two minutes DOLE: Thank you  Thank you  Mr  President  for those kind words  Thank the people of Hartford  the Commission  and all those out here who may be listening or watching It's a great honor for me to be here standing here as the Republican nominee  I'm very proud to be the Republican nominee reaching out to Democrats and Independents I have three very special people with me tonight: My wife  Elizabeth; my daughter  Robin  who has never let me down  and a fellow named Frank Carafa from New York  along with Ollie Manninen who helped me out in the mountains of Italy a few years back I've learned from them that people do have tough times  And sometimes you can't go it alone  And that's what America is all about I remember getting my future back from doctors and nurses and a doctor in Chicago named Dr  Kalikian   And ever since that time  I've tried to give something back to my country  to the people who are watching us tonight America is the greatest place on the face of the earth  Now  I know millions of you still have anxieties  You work harder and harder to make ends meet and put food on the table  You worry about the quality and the safety of your children  and the quality of education  But even more importantly  you worry about the future and will they have the same opportunities that you and I have had And Jack Kemp and I want to share with you some ideas tonight  Jack Kemp is my running mate  doing an outstanding job  Now  I'm a plain speaking man and I learned long ago that your word was your bond  And I promise you tonight that I'll try to address your concerns and not try to exploit them  It's a tall order  but I've been running against the odds for a long time and  again  I'm honored to be here this evening LEHRER: Mr  President  first question  There is a major difference in your view of the role of the Federal government and that of Senator Dole  How would you define the difference CLINTON: w ell  Jim  I believe that the Federal government should give people the tools and try to establish the conditions in which they can make the most of their own lives  That  to me  is the key  And that leads me to some different conclusions from Senator Dole For example  we have reduced the size of the Federal government to its smallest size in 30 years  w e reduced more regulations  eliminated more programs than my two Republican predecessors  But I have worked hard for things like the Family and Medical Leave Law  the Brady Bill  the assault weapons ban  the program to put 100 000 police on the street  All of these are programs that Senator Dole opposed that I supported  because I felt they were a legitimate effort to help people make the most of their own lives  I've worked hard to help families impart values to their own children  I supported the V chip so that parents would be able to control what their kids watch on television when they're young  along with the ratings systems for television and educational television  I supported strong action against the tobacco companies to stop the marketing  advertising  and sale of tobacco to young people  I supported a big increase in the safe and drug free schools program  These were areas on which Senator Dole and I differed  but I believed they were the right areas for America to be acting together as one country to help individuals and families make the most of their own lives and raise their kids with good values and a good future LEHRER: Senator Dole  one minute DOLE: I think the basic difference is  and I have had some experience in this  I think the basic difference  I trust the people  The President trusts the government  w e go back and look at the healthcare plan that he wanted to impose on the American people  One seventh the total economy  17 new taxes  price controls  35 to 50 new bureaucracies that cost $1 5 trillion  Don't forget that  that happened in 1993  A tax increase  a tax on everybody in America  Not just the rich  If you made 25 000 as the original proposal  you got your Social Security taxes increased  w e had a BTU tax we turned into a $35 million gas tax  a $265 billion tax increase I guess I rely more on the individual  I carry a little card in my pocket called the Tenth Amendment  w here possible  I want to give power back to the states and back to the people  That's my difference with the President  w e'll have specific differences later  He noted a few  but there are others LEHRER: Mr  President  30 seconds CLINTON: I trust the people  w e've done a lot to give the people more powers to make their own decisions over their own lives  But I do think we are right when we try to  for example  give mothers and newborns 48 hours before they can be kicked out of the hospital  ending these drive by deliveries I think we were right to pass the Kassebaum Kennedy bill  which says you can't lose your health insurance just because you change jobs or because someone in your family's been sick  Our government is smaller and less bureaucratic and has given more authority to the states than its two predecessors under Republican presidents  But I do believe we have to help our people get ready to succeed in the 21st Century LEHRER: Senator Dole  the President said in his opening statement we are better off today than we were four years ago  Do you agree DOLE: w ell  he's better off than he was four years ago CLINTON: I agree with that  That's right DOLE: And I may be better off four years from now  but I don't know  I looked at the slowest growth in the century  He inherited a growth of 4 7 4 8 percent  now it's down to about 2 4 percent  w e're going to pass a million bankruptcies this year for the first time in history  w e've got stagnant wages  In fact  women's wages have dropped 2 2 percent  Men's wages haven't gone up  gone down  So we have stagnation w e have the highest foreign debt in history  And it seems to me that if you take a look  are you better off  w ell  I guess some may be better off  Saddam Hussein is probably better off than he was four years ago  Renee Proval (ph) is probably better off than he was four years ago  But are the American people  They're working harder and higher and harder paying more taxes  For the first time in history  you pay about 40 percent of what you earn  More than you spend for food  clothing and shelter combined for taxes under this administration  So some may be better off They talk about family income being up  That's not true in Connecticut  family income is down  And it's up in some cases because both parents are working  One works for the family  and one works to pay taxes for the government  w e're going to give them tax cuts so they can spend more time with their children  maybe even take a vacation  That's what America is all about LEHRER: One minute  Mr  President CLINTON: w ell  let me say  first of all  in February Senator Dole acknowledged that the American economy was in the best shape it's been in in 30 years  w e have ten and a half million more jobs  a faster job growth rate than under any Republican administration since the 1920s  w ages are goings up for the first time in a decade  w e have record numbers of new small businesses  w e have the biggest drop in the number of people in poverty in 27 years  All groups of people are growing  w e had the biggest drop in income inequality in 27 years in 1995 The average family's income has gone up over $1600 just since our economic plan passed  So I think it's clear that we're better off than we were four years ago  Now we need to focus on what do we need to do to be better off still  How can we help people as we are to get their retirements when they work for small businesses  to be able to afford health insurance  to be able to educate their children  That's what I want to focus on  But we are clearly better off than we were four years ago  as Senator Dole acknowledged this year LEHRER: Senator Dole DOLE: I doubt that I acknowledged that this year  But in any event  I think we just look at the facts  w e ask the people that are viewing tonight  are you better off than you were four years ago  It's not whether we're better off  it's whether they're better off Are you working harder to put food on the table  feed your children  Are your children getting a better education  Drug use has doubled the past 44 months all across America  Crime has gone down but it's because the mayors like Rudy Giuliani where one third of the drop happened in one city  New York City So  yes  some may be better off  But of the people listening tonight  the working families who will benefit from economic packages  they'll be better off when Bob Dole is president and Jack Kemp is vice president LEHRER: Mr  President  Senator Dole has come pretty close in the last few days to accusing you of lying about his position on Medicare reform  Have you done so CLINTON: Absolutely not  Let's look at the position  First of all  remember that in this campaign season  since Senator Dole's been a candidate  he has bragged about the fact that he voted against Medicare in the beginning  in 1965  one of only 12 members  He said he did the right thing then  he knew it wouldn't work at the time  That's what he said Then his budget that he passed along with Speaker Gingrich cut Medicare $270 billion  more than was necessary to repair the Medicare trust fund  It would have charged seniors more for out of pocket costs as well as more in premiums because doctors could have charged them more  The American Medical  Hospital Association  the Nurses Association  the Catholic Hospital Association all said hundreds of hospitals could close and people would be hurt badly under the Dole Gingrich Medicare plan that I vetoed And now with this risky $550 billion tax scheme of Senator Dole's  even his own friends  his campaign co chair  Senator D'Amato  says that they can't possibly pay for it without cutting Medicare more and cutting Social Security as well  according to him Now  my balanced budget plan adds ten years to the life of the Medicare trust fund  ten years  And we'll have time to deal with the long term problems of the baby boomers  But it was simply wrong to finance their last scheme to cut Medicare $270 billion to run the risk of it withering on the vine  w e always had to reform it over the years  but we need somebody who believes it in to reform it LEHRER: Senator Dole DOLE: w ell  I must say  I look back at the vote on Medicare in 1965  we had a program called Eldercare that also provided drugs and means tests to people who needed medical attention received it  I thought it was a good program  But I've supported Medicare ever since In fact  I used to go home  my mother would tell me  Bob  all I've got is my Social Security and my Medicare  don't cut it  I wouldn't violate anything my mother said  In fact  we had a conversation about our mothers one day  a very poignant conversation in the w hite House  I'm concerned about healthcare  I've had the best healthcare from government hospitals  Army hospitals and I know its importance  but we've got to fix it  It's his trustees  the President's trustees  not mine  who says it's going to go broke  He doesn't fix it for ten years  w e ought to appoint a commission  just as we did in Social Security in 1983  when we rescued Social Security  and I was proud to be on that commission  along with Claude Pepper  the champion of senior citizens from Florida  And we can do it again  if we take politics out of it  Stop scaring the seniors  Mr  President  You've already spent $45 million scaring seniors and tearing me apart  I think it's time to have a truce LEHRER: Mr  President CLINTON: w ell  let me say  first of all  I'd be happy to have a commission deal with this and I appreciate what Senator Dole did on the '83 Social Security commission  But it won't be possible to do  if his tax scheme passes because even his own campaign co chair  Senator D'Amato  says he'll have to cut Medicare even more than was cut in the bill that I vetoed  I vetoed that bill because it cut more Medicare and and basically ran the risk of breaking up the system  My balanced budget plan puts ten years on the Medicare  w e ought to do that  then we can have a commission  But Senator Dole's plans are not good for the country LEHRER: Senator Dole  speaking of your tax plan  do you still think that's a good idea  the 15 percent across the board tax cut DOLE: Oh  yes  And you'll be eligible CLINTON: Me too DOLE: And so will the former President  yes CLINTON: I need it DOLE: w ell  the people need it  that's the point  This is not a w all Street tax cut  This is a family tax cut  This is a Main Street tax cut  15 percent across    let's take a family making $30 000 a year  that's $1261  Now  maybe to some in this Bushnell Memorial that it's not a lot of money  but people watching tonight with a couple of kids  a working family  that's four or five months of day care  maybe a personal computer; it's may be three or four months of mortgage payments  This economic package is about families but it's a six point package  First of all  it's a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution which President Clinton defeated  He twisted arms and got six Democrats to vote the other way  but we lost by one vote  It's balancing a budget by the year 2002  It's a tax cut  cutting capital gains 50 percent  So you can go out and create more jobs and more opportunities  It's a state tax relief  It's a $500 per child tax credit  It's about litigation reforms Now that the President gets millions of dollars from the trial lawyers  he probably doesn't like this provision  In fact  when I fell off the podium in Chico  before I lit the ground  hit the ground I had call on my cell phone from a trial lawyer saying I think we've got a case here  And it's also regulatory reform  It's a good package  Mr  President  w e'd like to have your support LEHRER: Mr  President CLINTON: w ell  here's the problem with it: It sounds very good  but there's a reason that 500 economists  including seven Nobel prize winners and business periodicals like Business w eek  and even Senator Dole's friends  Senator w arren Rudman  former Republican senator from New Hampshire  says it's not a practical program  It's a $550 billion tax scheme that will cause a big hole in the deficit which will raise interest rates and slow down the economy and cause people to pay more for home mortgages  car payments  credit card payments  college loans  and small business loans  It's not good to raise the deficit  w e worked too hard to lower it  It will actually raise taxes on nine million people and  in addition to that  it will force bigger cuts in Medicare  Medicaid  education and the environment than the ones that he and Mr  Gingrich passed that I vetoed last year  So it sounds great  but our targeted tax cut for education  child rearing  healthcare and home buying  which is paid for in my balanced budget plan  something that he has not done  certified by the Congressional budget office  that's the right way to go DOLE: The President wants to increase spending 20 percent over the next six years  I want to increase spending 14 percent  that's how simple it is  I want the government to pinch pennies for a change instead of the American families  w e're talking about six percentage points over six years  and with that money you give it back to the working people  You also provide opportunity scholarships so low income parents will have the same choice that others have in sending their children to better schools  It will work  and when it does work  Mr  President  I know you'll congratulate me LEHRER: Mr  President  the Senator mentioned trial lawyers and campaign  that means campaign financing  How do you personally avoid being unduly influenced by people who give you money or give you services in your campaigns CLINTON: w ell  I try to articulate my positions as clearly as possible  tell people what I stand for and let them decide whether they're going to support me or not The Senator mentioned the trial lawyers  In the case of the product liability bill  which they passed and I vetoed  I think that's what he's talking about  I actually wanted to sign that bill  And I told the people exactly what the Congress exactly what kind of bill I would sign  Now  a lot of the trial lawyers didn't want me to sign any bill at all  but I had thought we ought to do what we could to cut frivolous lawsuits  but they wouldn't make some of the changes that I thought should be made Now  let me just give you an example  I had a person in the Oval Office who lost a child in a school bus accident where a drunk driver caused the accident directly  but there were problems with the school bus  The drunk driver had no money  Under the new bill  if I had signed it  a person like that could never have had any recovery  I thought that was wrong  So I gave four or five specific examples to the Congress and said  prove to me that these people could recover but we're going to eliminate frivolous lawsuits  I'll sign the bill  But generally I believe that a president has to be willing to do what he thinks is right  I've done a lot of things that were controversial  My economic plan  my trade position  Bosnia  Haiti  taking on the NRA for the first time  taking on the tobacco companies for the first time  Sometimes you just have to do that because you know it's right for the country over the long run  That's what I've tried to do and that's what I will continue to do as president LEHRER: Senator Dole DOLE: How does he avoid conflict  w ell  I don't know in the case of the trial lawyers  I look at the trial lawyers  and when you're a few million short  you run out to Hollywood and pick up two to four million and organized labor comes to w ashington  D C  and puts 35 million into the pot  Now  if these aren't special interests  I've got a lot to learn  I was there for a while before I left on June the 11th  The trial lawyers and I don't    you know  my wife's a lawyer  w e're the only two lawyers in w ashington that trust each other  But we're lawyers  I like lawyers  I don't dislike trial lawyers  But it seemed to me there's got to be some end to the frivolous lawsuits and there's got to be some cap on punitive damage  You're putting a lot of business people out of business  Small businessmen and businesswomen who paid 70 percent of your ninteen   your$265 billion tax increase  the largest tax increase in the history of America  I said that one day and Pat Moynihan  a Democrat  say  no  he said  in the history of the world  So I modified it  the largest tax increase in the history of the world  And it seems to me that there is a problem there  Mr  President  And I will address you as Mr  President  You didn't do that with Mr  with President Bush in 1992 LEHRER: Mr  President CLINTON: Let me say  first of all  I signed a tort reform bill that dealt with civilian aviation a couple of years ago  I proved that I will sign reasonable tort reform  Secondly  Senator Dole had some pretty harsh comments about special interest money  but it wasn't me who opposed what we tried to do to save the lives of children who were subject to tobacco and then went to the tobacco growers and bragged about standing up for the Federal government when we tried to stop the advertising  marketing  and sales of tobacco to children  And it wasn't me that let the polluters actually come into the halls of Congress  into the rooms  and rewrite the environmental laws  That's what Speaker Gingrich and Senator Dole did  not me DOLE: That's not true CLINTON: So I believe that we should take a different approach to this and talk about how we stand on the issues instead of trying to characterize each other's motivations  I think Senator Dole and I just honestly disagree LEHRER: w ell  Senator Dole  let me ask you the same question I asked the President: How do you avoid being influenced by people who contribute money and services to your campaigns DOLE: I think it's very difficult  Let's be honest about it  That's why we need campaign finance reform  That's why I reach out to the Perot voters  w e've done about all  we are the reform party  the Republican Party  And the Perot voters that are looking for a home ought to take a look at the Republican record  w hatever it is  whatever the checklist was in '92  it's all done with campaign finance reform  I worked with Senator Mitchell  who played me  I guess  in the debate warmup  w e tried six or eight years ago  He appointed three people  I appointed three people to get campaign finance reform  w e couldn't get it done  because I wasn't enforceable You've suggested a commission  Newt Gingrich did  I suggested that at least four or five years ago  w e have a commission on campaign finance reform  They send it to Congress  and we have to vote it up or down  That's how it works  w e are never going to fix it by the parties  because Democrats want a better advantage for themselves  we want a better advantage as Republicans  and that's not how it's going to work But I want to touch on this is tobacco thing  I know the President's been puffing a lot on that  But I want to go back to 1965  That was my first vote against tobacco companies when I said we ought to label cigarettes  And I've had a consistent record ever since 1965  w e passed a bill in 1992 that encouraged the states to adopt programs to stop kids from smoking  All 50 states did it  It took three and a half years  It wasn't until election year  Mr  President  that you ever thought about stopping smoking w hat about drugs that have increased  doubled in the last 44 months  Cocaine is up 141 percent    marijuana  cocaine up 166 percent  It seems to me that you have a selective memory  You know  mine doesn't work that way  So I just want to try to correct it as we go along CLINTON: Mr  Lehrer  I hope we'll have a chance to discuss drugs later in the program  But let me respond to what you said  I agree that too many incumbent politicians in w ashington in both parties have consistently opposed campaign finance reform  That was certainly the case from the minute I got there  So after Speaker Gingrich and Senator Dole took over the Congress  I went to New Hampshire and a man suggested    a gentleman that unfortunately just passed away a couple of days ago  suggested that we appoint a commission  And I shook hands with him on it and I appointed my members  and the commission never met  And then Senator Dole's ardent supporters  Senator McCain  who's out there today  along with Senator Feingold  supported  sponsored a campaign finance reform proposal  I strongly supported it  And members of Senator Dole's own party in the Senate killed it  And he was not out there urging them to vote for the McCain Feingold bill  So I think the American people  including the Perot supporters  know that I have had a consistent record in favor of campaign finance reform  and I will continue to have  And I hope we can finally get it in the next session of Congress  because we need it badly LEHRER: Senator Dole  30 seconds DOLE: w ell  on campaign reform itself  we're going to get it when we have a bipartisan commission  take it out of politics  Get people who don't have any interest in politics but understand the issue and let them make the recommendation to Congress  Now  we're now kidding anybody  Mr  President  These are sophisticated people watching tonight  Millions and millions of Americans  They know the Republican Party hasn't done it  They know the Democratic party won't do it  w e ought to agree that somebody else should do it  And we have to vote it up or down  Mr  President LEHRER: Mr  President  the Senator mentioned drugs  He suggested that you are    you bear some responsibility for the rise in drug use of teenagers in the United States  Is he right CLINTON: w ell  Jim  I think every American in any position of responsibility should be concerned about what's happened  I am  But let's look at the overall record  Overall in America cocaine use has dropped 30 percent in the last four years  casual drug use down 13 percent  The tragedy is that our young people are still increasing their use of drugs up to about 11 percent total with marijuana  and I regret it  Let me tell you what I tried to do about it  I appointed a four star general who led our efforts south of the border to keep drugs from coming into the country as our nation's drug czar  The most heavily directed  decorated solder in uniform when he retired  w e submitted the biggest drug budget ever  w e have dramatically increased control and enforcement at the border  w e supported a a crime bill that had 60 death penalties including  including the death penalty for drug kingpins  And I supported a big expansion in safe and drug free schools program to support things like the DARE program because I thought all those things were very important  Do I think that I bear some responsibility for the fact that too many of our children still don't understand drugs are wrong  drugs can kill you  Even though I have consistently opposed the legalization of drugs all my public life and worked hard against them  I think we all do  And I hope we can do better  I don't think this issue should be politicized because my record is clear and I don't think Senator Dole supports using using drugs  I think we just have to continue to work on this until those who think it isn't dangerous and won't kill them and won't destroy their lives  get the message and change LEHRER: Senator DOLE: Again  well it's  you are very selective  Mr  President  You don't want to politicize drugs  but it's already politicized Medicare  go out and scare senior citizens and other vulnerable groups  veterans and people who get Pell Grants and things like this  I mean  you say we've done all these bad things  which isn't the case  But it seems to me the record is clear  The record is pretty clear in Arkansas  when you were governor  Drug use doubled  You resisted the appointment of a drug czar there because you thought it might interfere with treatment  But here you cut the drug czar's office 83 percent  You cut interdiction substantially  I mean that's what  I want to stop it from coming across the border  And in my administration  we're going to train the National Guard to stop it from coming across the border  This is a invasion of drugs from all over the world  And we have a responsibility  You had a surgeon    or before General McCaffrey (ph) you had a lady who said we ought to consider legalizing drugs  Is that the kind of leadership we need  And I won't comment on other things that happened in your administration or your past about drugs  But it seems to me the kids ought to    if they've started  they ought to stop and just don't do it LEHRER: Mr  President CLINTON: Let me say again  we did have a drug czar in Arkansas  but he answered to the governor  just like this one answers to the President  That's what I thought we ought to do Secondly  Senator Dole  you voted against the crime bill that had the death penalty for drug kingpins in it  And you voted to cut services to 23 million school children under the safe and drug free schools act  I don't think that means you're soft on drugs  w e just have a different approach  But let me remind you  my family has suffered from drug abuse  I know what it's like to see somebody you love nearly lose their lives  and I hate drugs  Senator  w e need to do this together and we can LEHRER: Senator Dole  on the government  continuing to talk about the government's role  If elected President  would you seek to repeal the Brady Bill and the ban on assault weapons DOLE: Not if I didn't have a better idea  But I've got a better idea  It's something I've worked on for 15 years  It's called the automated check or the instant check  It's being used in 17 states right now  States like Florida  Colorado  Virginia  and other states  You don't buy any gun  You don't get any gun  w e've got 20 million names on a computer in w ashington  D C  of people who should not have guns  w e ought to keep guns out of the hands of criminals  And  there are eight other categories that should not have guns  I've been working on this for a long  long time  You walk in  you put your little card in there  If it says tilt  you don't get any gun  You don't get a hand gun  you don't get a rifle  you don't get a shot gun  you get zippo If we're going to protect American children and American families and people who live as prisoners in their own home  we've got to stop guns from being dumped on the street The administration says they support the instant check  They've appropriated about $200 million  but only spent about $3 million to get it underway  In our administration  in my administration  we will expedite  This keeps up with technology  It keeps guns out of the hands of people who should not have guns  That is the bottom line  And I believe it's a good idea  has strong bipartisan support  And perhaps that's another thing we can depoliticize You talk about the Brady Bill  There has only been one prosecution under the Brady    only one under the assault weapon ban and only seven under the Brady Bill that you talk about all the time  And on the assault weapon ban  out of 17 weapons that were banned  only six banned now because eleven have been modified and are back on the street  Let's get together on this instant check because that will really make a difference LEHRER: Mr  President CLINTON: Let me say  first of all  Senator Dole has gone back and forth about whether he'd be for repealing the Brady Bill or repealing the assault weapons ban  And I think his present position is he would not do so  and if that's true I'm grateful for it  But let's look at the facts here  The Brady Bill has kept at least 60 000 felons  fugitives and stalkers from getting hand guns  Senator Dole led the fight against the Brady Bill  He tried to keep it from coming to my desk  He didn't succeed and I signed it and I'm glad I did Then when we had the assault weapons ban in the Senate  Senator Dole fought it bitterly and opposed the entire crime bill and almost brought the entire crime bill down because the National Rifle Association didn't want the assault weapons ban  just like they didn't want the Brady Bill  But two years later nobody's lost their handguns  I mean  their rifles  w e've expanded the Brady Bill to cover people who beat up their spouses and their kids  And this is a safer country  So I'm glad I took on that fight and I believe  with all respect  I was right and he was wrong DOLE: w ell  the President doesn't have it quite right  I mean  it seemed to me at the time the assault weapon ban was not effective  But that's history  I told the NRA that's history  You're not going to worry about it anymore  I'm not going to worry about it anymore  Let's do something better  Let's stop  you know  playing the political game  Mr  President  Talking about this and this  You add all the states that've used the instant check and how many weapons they keep  kept out of the hands of criminals  It would far surpass the numbers you mentioned  So in my view  if you want to be protected  you ought to vote for Bob Dole and we'll get the instant check passed and we'll keep guns out of the hands of criminals LEHRER: Mr  President  Senator Dole said the other day that you practiced a photo op foreign policy that has lessened the credibility of the United States throughout the world  Is he wrong about that CLINTON: If he  that's what he said  he's not right about that  Look at where we are today  The United States is still the indispensable nation in the aftermath of the Cold w ar and on the brink of the 21st Century  I have worked to support our country as the world's strongest force for peace and freedom  prosperity and security w e have done the following things: Number one  we've managed the aftermath of the Cold w ar  supporting a big drop in nuclear weapons in Russia  The removal of Russian troops from the Baltics  The integration of Central and Eastern European democracies into a new partnership with NATO  And  I might add  with the democratic Russia There are no nuclear missiles pointed at the children of the United States tonight and have not been in our administration for the first time since the dawn of the nuclear age w e have worked hard for peace and freedom  w hen I took office  Haiti was governed by a dictator that had defied the United States  w hen I took office  the worst war in Europe was waging in Bosnia  Now there is a the democratically elected president in Haiti  Peace in Bosnia  w e just had the election there  w e've made progress in Northern Ireland  in the Middle East  w e've also stood up to the new threats of terrorism  The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction  organized crime  and we have worked hard to expand America's economic presence around the world with the biggest increase in trade with the largest new number of trade agreements in history And that's one of the reasons America is number one in auto production again LEHRER: Senator DOLE: w ell  I have a different view  Again  Iâ€™ve supported the President on Bosnia  and I think we were told the troops would be out in a year  Now I understand it's been extended 'til some time next year  But  let's start with Somalia  where they dragged Americans through the streets  and where 18 Americans were killed one day  because they didn't have  they were pinned down for eight hours  the rangers  They didn't have the weapons  they didn't have the tanks  They asked for the tanks  They didn't get the tanks from this administration because we were nation building  It's called mission creep  w e turn it over to the United Nations  The President didn't have much to do about it  You look at Haiti  where we spend about three billion dollars and we got an alarm call there about two weeks ago  You got to send down some more people  because the president's found out there are death squads on his on his  in his own property  So we need more protection from America  Bosnia  Northern Ireland  There's no ceasefire in Bosnia  I think there are still lot of problems in Bosnia  w e agreed to train and arm the Muslims so they could defend themselves  the policy you had when you ran in 1992  w e haven't done that  w e're way behind  which means Americans can't come home  Americans shouldn't have gone there in the first place  had we let them defend themselves  as they have a right to do under Article 57 of the United Nations charter LEHRER: Mr  President CLINTON: First of all  I take full responsibility for what happened in Somalia  but the American people must remember that those soldiers were under an American commander when that happened  I believe they did the best they could under the circumstances  and let's not forget that hundreds of thousands of lives were saved there Secondly  in Haiti  political violence is much  much smaller than it was  Thirdly  in Bosnia it's a virtual miracle that there has been no return to war and at least there has now been an election  And institutions are beginning to function In Northern Ireland  in the Middle East we are better off than we were four years ago  There will always be problems in this whole world  But if we're moving in the right direction and America is leading  we're better off LEHRER: Senator Dole  if elected president  what criteria would you use to decide when to send U S  troops into harm's way DOLE: w ell it  after w orld w ar I  we had  you know  a policy of disengagement  Then from w orld w ar I to w orld w ar II we had sort of a compulsory engagement policy  Now I think we have a selective engagement policy  w e have to determine when our interests are involved  not the United Nations' interests  And many of the things the President talked about  he turned over to the United Nations  They decided He's deployed more troops than any president in history around the world  It's cost us billions and billions of dollars for peace keeping operations  Look these are facts  And it seems to me that when you make a decision  the decision is made by the President of the United States  by the Commander in Chief  He makes that decision when he commits young men or young women who are going to go round and defend our liberty and our freedom  That would be my position Then I'm going to have a top down review at the Pentagon  not a bottom up review  w e all fight over how much money is there  I want a top down review to determine what our priorities are and what we should do in defense  and then follow that policy instead of this bottom up review with all the services fighting for the money  You know  the President said he was going to cut defense $60 billion  he cut defense $112 billion  Devastated states like California and others  And I think now we've got a problem  w e've got to go back and look  It's just like you said in Texas one day  you know raised taxes too much  and you did  and you cut defense too much  Mr  President  and you did  You may have said that  too But the bottom line is  we are the strongest nation in the world  w e provide the leadership and we're going to have to continue to provide the leadership  but let's do it on our terms when our interests are involved and not when somebody blows the whistle at the United Nations CLINTON: Our military is the strongest military in the world  It is the strongest  best prepared  best equipped it has ever been  There is very little difference in the budget that I proposed and the Republican budget over the next six year period  w e are spending a lot of money to modernize our weapons system  I have proposed a lot of new investments to improve the quality of life for our soldiers  for our men and women in uniform  for their families  for their training  That is my solemn obligation You ask when do you decide to deploy them  The interests of the American people must be at stake  Our values must be at stake  w e have to be able to make a difference  And frankly we have to consider what the risks are to our young men and women in uniform  But I believe the evidence is that our deployments have been successful  in Haiti  in Bosnia  when we moved to Kuwait to repel Saddam Hussein's threatened invasion of Kuwait  w hen I have sent the fleet into the Taiwan straits  w hen we've worked hard to end the Northern Korean nuclear threat I believe the United States is at peace tonight in part because of the disciplined  careful  effective deployment of our military resources LEHRER: Senator Dole DOLE: w ell I failed to mention North Korea and Cuba  a while ago  You look at North Korea where they have enough plutonium to build six nuclear bombs  w e've sort of distanced ourselves from our ally  South Korea  They lost about a million people in the war  the Korean w ar  the forgotten war  w e lost 53 000 Americans w e shouldn't be doing any favors for North Korea  It's a closed society  w e don't have any inspection  w e don't know whether it's going to work or not  but we keep giving the incentives  Someone called them something else  Incentives  w e don't know what's going to happen  Here we have Cuba 90 miles from our shores  and what have we done  we passed the law that gave people a right to sue and the President postponed it for six months  And it seemed to me if you want to send a signal  you've got to send a signal  Mr  President  The sooner the better off we'll be  if you put tougher sanctions on Castro  not try to make it easier for him LEHRER: Mr  President  what is your attitude toward Cuba and how Cuba should be treated CLINTON: w ell  first of all  for the last four years we have worked had to put more and more pressure on the Castro government to bring about more openness and move toward democracy  In 1992  before I became President  the Congress passed the Cuba Democracy Act and I enforced it vigorously  w e made the embargo tougher but we increased contacts people to people with the Cubans  including direct telephone service  which was largely supported by the Cuban American community  Then Cuba shot down two of our planes and murdered four people in international air space  They were completely beyond the pale of the law  and I signed the Helms Burton legislation  Senator Dole is correct  I did give about six months before the effective date of the act before lawsuits can actually be filed  even though they're effective now  and can be legally binding  because I want to change Cuba  And the United States needs help from other countries Nobody in the world agrees with our policy on Cuba now  But this law can be used as leverage to get other countries to help us to move Cuba to democracy  Every single country in Latin America  Central America and the Caribbean is a democracy tonight but Cuba  And if we stay firm and strong  we will be able to bring Cuba around as well DOLE: That's the point I made  w e have to be firm and strong  And I hope that will happen  It will happen starting next January and maybe it can happen the balance of this year  w e have not been firm and strong  You look at the poor people who still live in Cuba  It's a haven for drug smugglers and we don't have a firm policy when it comes to Fidel Castro  In my view  the policy has failed So Congress passes the law  the President signs it  like he does a lot of things  But he  like welfare reform  I'm going to sign it but I'm going to try to change it next year  A lot of these election year conversions  the President talks about the drug money  and all the other things  all this antismoking campaign all happened in 1996 And I think the people viewing out there ought to go back and take a look at the record when he fought a balanced budget amendment  w hen he gave you that biggest tax increase in history; when he tried to take over your healthcare system  w hen he fought regulatory reform that cost the average family 6 to $7 000 a year  This is a serious business  It's about your family; it's about your business  and in this case it's about a firmer policy with Cuba CLINTON: There were several off the subject quaffers in that litany  Let me just mention  Senator Dole voted for $900 billion in tax increases  His running mate Jack Kemp once said that Bob Dole never met a tax he didn't hike  And everybody knows  including the w all Street Journal  hardly a friend of the Democratic party of this administration  that the '82 tax increase he sponsored in inflation adjusted dollars was the biggest tax increase in American history  So we ought to at least get the facts out here on the table so we can know where to go from here LEHRER: Senator Dole  you mentioned health reform several times  w hat do you think should be done about the healthcare system DOLE: Let me first answer that question about the 1982 tax cut  w e were closing loopholes  we were going after big corporations  I know you probably would oppose it  Mr  President  but I think we should have a fairer system and a flatter system  and we'll have a fairer and flatter system and we're going to make the economic package work  Healthcare  w ell  we finally passed the Kassebaum bill  The President was opposed to it in 1993  He wanted to give us this big system  that took over about one seventh of the economy  that put on price controls  created all these state alliances  and would cost $1 5 trillion and force people into managed care  whether they wanted it or not  Most people want to see their own doctor  They're going to see their own doctor when Bob Dole is president  w e won't threaten anybody So we passed the Kassebaum Kennedy  the Kennedy Kassebaum bill that will cover about 20 to 25 million people  w e've been for that for four  five  six years  The President held it up  And even when it finally got near passage  Senator Kennedy held it up for 100 days  because he wasn't satisfied with one provision  But it will cover preexisting conditions  If you change your job  you're going to be covered  So there are a lot of good things in this bill we should have done instead of trying this massive  massive takeover by the Federal government  But then of course we had a Democratic Congress and they didn't want to do that  Until we got a Republican Congress  we finally got action  I'm proud of my colleagues in the Republican Party for getting that done  It means a lot to a lot of people watching us tonight CLINTON: w ell  that sounds very good  but it's very wrong  Senator Dole remembers well that we actually offered not to even put in a healthcare bill in 1994  uh '93  but instead to work with the Senate Republicans and write a joint bill  And they said no because they got a memo from one of their political advisers saying that instead they should characterize whatever we did as big government and make sure nothing was done to aid healthcare before the '94 elections so they could make that claim  w ell  maybe we bit off more than we could chew  but we're pursuing a step by step reform now  The Kennedy Kassebaum bill that I signed will make it possible for 25 million people to keep their health insurance when they change jobs or when somebody in their family's been sick  I signed a bill to stop these drive by deliveries when insurance companies can force people out of the hospital after 24 hours and I vetoed Senator Dole's Medicare plan that would have forced a lot of seniors into managed care and taken a lot more money out of their pockets and led to Medicare withering on the vine DOLE: w ell  many of the provisions in the Kassebaum bill were provisions that    my provisions  like deductions for long term care  making certain that self employed people that are watching tonight can deduct not 30 percent but 80 percent of you pay for premiums  You can also deduct long term care now  so it's a good it's a good start  I think there's enough    we're even looking at our tax cut proposal  our economic package  There may be a way of reaching out to the uninsured  because there are a lot of uninsured people in the country  particularly children  that should be covered  Another way you can do is to expand Medicaid  In America no one will go without healthcare  no one will go without food LEHRER: Senator  go ahead and finish your sentence DOLE: All right  Food LEHRER: Back to foreign affairs for a moment  Mr  President  Are you satisfied with the way you handled this last Iraq crisis and the end result CLINTON: w ell  I believe that we did the appropriate thing under the circumstances  Saddam Hussein is under a U N  resolution not to threaten his neighbors or threaten his own  repress his own citizens  Unfortunately  a lot of people  have never been as concerned about the Kurds as the United States has tried to be  and we've been flying an operation to protect them out of Turkey for many years now  w hat happened was one of the Turkish  one of the Kurdish leaders invited him to go up north  but we felt since the whole world community had told him not to do it  that once he did it we had to do something  w e did not feel that I could commit  I certainly didn't feel I should commit American troops to throw him out of where he had gone  and that was the only way to do that  So the appropriate thing strategically to do was to reduce his ability to threaten his neighbors  w e did that by expanding what's called the no fly zone by increasing our allies' control of the air space now from the Kuwait border to the suburbs of Baghdad  w as it the right thing to do  I believe it was  Is it fully effective  Did it make him withdraw from the north  w ell  he does   he has a little bit  and I hope he will continue  w e have learned that you give him an inch he'll take a mile  w e had to do something  and even though not all of our allies supported it at first  I think most of them now believe that what we did was an appropriate thing to do LEHRER: Senator Dole DOLE: w ell  the president's own CIA director says Saddam is stronger now than he was  I don't understand extending the no fly zone in the south when the trouble was in the north  And what we've done during the Bush administration  the Kurds were at the State Department  negotiating  trying to work their differences out  Now we've got all thousands and thousands of refugees  w e're even shipping 3 000 Kurds to Guam  It involves Turkey  It's a real problem  Saddam is probably about as strong as he ever was  w e shot  what  44 cruise missiles  worth about a million two a piece  and hit some radar  that repaired in a couple  three days  Did we inflict any damage  No  Did we have any allies helping  w ell  we have Great Britain  They're always very loyal to us  and I appreciate that  And of course Kuwait  Even though they had to find out they had 5 000 troops coming  they didn't even understand that  w e had to get their permission  The bottom line is  we went in there alone  w e are supposed to be operating under a U N  resolution  w e did it without any of our allies that helped in the Gulf CLINTON: Senator Dole has two or three times before tonight criticized me for working with the U N  Now I'm being criticized for not working with the U N DOLE: It's not the U N CLINTON: Sometimes the United States has to act alone or at least has to act first  Sometimes we cannot let other countries have a veto on our foreign policy  I could not send soldiers into the north of Iraq  that would have been wrong  It could reduce Saddam Hussein's abilities to threaten Kuwait and his other neighbors again  That's what I did  I still believe it was the right thing to do LEHRER: Senator Dole  on your photo op foreign policy charge against the President   DOLE: Not mine LEHRER: Oh  No  no  I mean your charge against the President  that he has a photo op foreign policy  Does the Middle East summit last week fall into that category DOLE: w ell  there were some good pictures  but does it fall into that category  I don't know  I want to be very serious  I've supported the President when I thought he was right on Bosnia  I supported him on NAFTA and GATT  So it's not that we always disagree  Others disagreed with us The Mideast is very difficult  But it seemed to me just as an observer that you know before you'd call somebody to America  you'd have some notion what the end result might be  Now maybe it's better just to get together and sit down and talk  Maybe that was the purpose  And I know talks have started again today  But again it's almost like an ad hoc foreign policy  It's ad hoc  it's sort of we get up in the morning and read the papers  what country's in trouble  we'll have a meeting Now  to me that's not the strategy that I think people expect from America  I think we have lost credibility  and I say this very honestly without any partisanship  w e've lost credibility around the world  Our allies know     they're not certain what we're going to do  what our reaction  what our response is going to be  Nobody suggested sending troops to Iraq  if that was the hint there from the President  But I do think that Saddam Hussein is stronger than he was  And I do believe that we didn't gain a great deal in the Mideast by bringing three of the four leaders  one refused to come  to w ashington D C CLINTON: w e have a very consistent policy in the Middle East: It is to support the peace process; to support the security of Israel; and to support those who are prepared to take risks for peace  It is a very difficult environment  The feelings are very strong  There are extremists in all parts of the Middle East who want to kill that peace process  Prime Minister Rabin gave his life because someone in his own country literally hated him for trying to bring peace  I would like to have had a big  organized summit  but those people were killing each other  rapidly  innocent Arab children  innocent Israeli people  they were dying  And there is  so much trust has broken down in the aftermath of the change of government  I felt that if I could just get the parties together to say let's stop the violence  start talking  commit to the negotiations  that would be a plus Now today the Secretary of State is in the Middle East and they've started negotiations and all those leaders promised me they would not quit until they resolved the issues between them and got the peace process going forward again LEHRER: Senator Dole DOLE: w ell  I was disappointed  The President has not called for an unconditional end to the violence  It seemed to me the violence stopped when these leaders came to America  The killing and tragedies had taken place  And it is unfortunate  it is a difficult area  no doubt about it  It shouldn't be politicized in any way by the President or by his opponent  And I don't intend to politicize it  I hope they talked and I hope they've reached some result and that the killing will end CLINTON: Thank you LEHRER: Mr  President  in your acceptance speech in Chicago  you said the real choice in this race is  quote  whether we build a bridge to the future or a bridge to the past; about whether we believe our best days are still out there or our best days are behind us; about whether we want a country of people all working together or one where you're on your own  end quote  Are you saying that you believe Senator Dole is a man of the past and if elected president he would lead the country backward CLINTON: w ell  I'm saying that Senator Dole said in his fine speech in San Diego that he wanted to build a bridge to the past  And I think I know what he meant by that  He's troubled  as I am  by some of the things that go on today  But I believe America is the greatest country in human history because we have maintained freedom and increasing prosperity by relentlessly pushing the barriers of knowledge  the barriers of the present  always moving into the future  That's why when I became President I was determined to kind of move beyond this whole stale debate that had gone on in w ashington for too long to get this country moving again  And that's why we've got a country with ten and a half million more jobs  and record numbers of new businesses  and rising incomes  and falling crime rates  and welfare roll rates  That's why we're moving in the right direction  And I'm trying to emphasize that what I want to do is to continue to do that  That's why my balanced budget plan will still invest and grow this economy  That's why I want a tax cut for education and child rearing  but it's got to be paid for  That's why I want to continue the work we have done over partisan opposition  to work with communities to bring that crime rate down until our streets are all safe again  These are my commitments  I am very oriented toward the future  I think this election has to be geared toward the future  I think America's best days are still ahead  but we've got to build the right bridge LEHRER: Senator Dole DOLE: You know  the President reminds me sometimes of my brother Kenny  who is no longer alive  But Kenny was a great talker  And he used to tell me things that I knew were not quite accurate  So we always had a rule  we divided by six  Maybe in your case maybe just two  But 11 million new jobs and everything  I mean the President can't take credit for everything that governors are doing  whether that's happening in New York City when it comes to the murder rate and then not be responsible for the bad things that happen  whether it's drug use or something else in America  So it seems to me that we can talk about what we call Kenny  the great exaggerator  He just liked to make it sound exager  a little better  made him feel better w hen it comes to bridges  I want a bridge to the future  I also want a bridge to the truth  w e have to tell the truth  w e've got people watching tonight and listening tonight trying to find the truth  And the truth is  there is a lot wrong with America  w e need a strong economic package; we need a tax cut; we need the $500 child credit  and we'll have that soon LEHRER: Mr  President CLINTON: I do not for a moment think I'm entitled to all the credit for all the good things that have happened in America  But where I have moved to work with the American people to help them have the tools to make the most of their own lives  I think I should get some credit for that I also personally took responsibility tonight when Senator Dole asked me about the drug problem  But  you know  I think my ideas are better for the future Senator Dole voted against student loans  against Headstart  against creating the Department of Education  If he gets elected president  we'll start the new century without anyone in the cabinet of the President representing education in our children  I personally don't think that's the right kind of future for America  and I think we ought to take a different tack LEHRER: Senator Dole  do you still favor eliminating the Department of Education DOLE: Yes  I didn't favor it when it was in  started  I voted against it  It was a tribute after President Carter's election to the National Education Association who send a lot of delegates to the Democratic convention  who gives 99 5 percent of their money  Democrat Democrats  and the President  and a lot of the teachers send their kids to private schools or better public schools  So what we want to do is called opportunity scholarships  Now  some say  oh  you're a Republican  you can't be reaching out to these people  I've reached out to people all my life  I've worked on the food stamp program  proudly  And the w IC program  and the school lunch program with senators like George McGovern  Hubert Humphrey and others  to name a few of my Democratic friends I'm not some extremist out here  I care about people  I have my own little foundation that's raised about $10 million for the disabled  I don't advertise it  Just did  haven't before  And I try to do a lot of things that I think might be helpful to people So it seems to me that we ought to take that money we can save from the Department of Education  put it into opportunity scholarships and tell little Landale Shakespeare out in Cleveland  Ohio  and tell your mother and father  you're going to get to go to school because we're going to match what the state puts up  and you're going to go to the school of your choice  I don't fault the President or the vice president for sending their children to private schools or better schools  I applaud them for it  I don't criticize them  But why shouldn't everybody have that choice  w hy shouldn't low income Americans and low middle income Americans  I'm excited about it  It's going to be a big  big opportunity for a lot of people CLINTON: Let me say first of all  I'm all for students having more choices  w e've worked hard to expand public school choice in my balanced budget bill  There's funds for 3 000 new schools created by teachers and parents  sometimes by business people  called charter schools that have no rules  they're free of bureaucracy and can only stay in existence if they perform and teach children  The ones that are out there are doing well w hat I'm against is Senator Dole's plan to take money away from all the children we now help with limited Federal funds and help far fewer  If we're going to have a private voucher plan  that ought to be done at the local level or the state level  But Senator Dole has consistently opposed Federal help to education  He voted against student loans; he voted against my improved student loan plan; he voted against the National Service bill  against the HeadStart bill; he voted against our efforts in safe and drug free schools  He voted against these programs  he does not believe it  That's the issue  90 percent of our kids are out there in those public schools and we need to lift their standards and move them forward with the programs like those I've outlined in this campaign DOLE: I'd better correct the President  I don't know what time it is  but it's probably getting late  I want to correct  the all these things I voted against  they were probably part of some big package that had a lot of pork in it or a lot of things that we shouldn't have had and we probably voted no  I've supported all the education programs  I've supported Headstart  I think we ought to look at it  So I don't want anybody out there to think we've just been voting no  no  no  Let's give low income parents the same right that people of power and prestige have in America and let them go to better schools  Let's not  let's help  let's turn the schools back to the teachers and back to the parents and take it away from the National Education Association LEHRER: Mr  President  what is wrong with the school choice proposal CLINTON: I support school choice  I support school choice  I have advocated expansions of public school choice alternatives and I said the creation of 3 000 new schools that we are going to help the states to finance  But if you're going to have a private voucher plan  that ought to be determined by states in localities where they're raising and spending most of the money I simply think it's wrong to take money away from programs that are helping build basic skills for kids  90 percent of them are in the public schools; to take money away from programs that are helping fund the school lunch program  that are helping to fund the other programs  that are helping our schools to improve their standards  Our schools are getting better  and our schools can be made to be even better still with the right kind of community leadership and partnership at the school level I have been a strong force for reform  And  Senator  I remind you that a few years ago when I supported teacher testing while in my home state I was pretty well lambasted by the teachers association  I just don't believe we ought to be out there running down teachers and attacking them the way you did at the Republican convention  I think we ought to be lifting them up and moving our children forward And let me just say that budget that you passed that I vetoed would have cut 50 000 kids out of Headstart  It would have eliminated the AmeriCorps plan and it would have cut back on student loans and scholarships  Now  it would have  That's a fact  That's one of the big reasons I vetoed it  w e need to be doing more in education  not less DOLE: w ell  the AmeriCorps program  I must say  if that's one of your successes  I wouldn't speak about it too loudly  It costs about $27 000 to pay people to volunteer  w e've got four million young people volunteering every year  the number hasn't gone down  And you pick out 20 000  whether they need the money or not  and they get paid for volunteering  I like young people  I like teachers  I'm a product of a public school  You attended a private school for some time in your life  I like teachers  You're not for school choice  you can't be for school choice  because this is that special interest money again  w hen you get 99 5 percent of the money  we don't know what happened to the other  5 percent  we're looking for it  somebody got it  but it all went to Democrats  And this is part of that liberal establishment  one of those liberal things that you just can't do  You're for school uniforms and curfews and you're opposed to truancy  Now that's not reform  Mr  President  w hy can't Landale Shakespeare in Cleveland or Pilar Gonzales in Milwaukee give their children an opportunity to go to a better school  Some schools aren't safe  Some schools aren't even safe  Your choice is nothing  Let's give them a real choice  the kind of choice you had  and the kind of choice a lot of people have in America  If we want to stop crime and teenage pregnancy  let's start with education CLINTON: First of all  Senator Dole  let's set the record straight  I was able for two years when I was in  a very young boy to go to a Catholic school  but I basically went to public schools all my life  And I've worked hard for a long time to make them better  90 percent of our kids are there  You  it's amazing to me  you are all for having more responsibility at the local level for everything except schools  w here we don't have very much money at the Federal level to spend on education  we ought to spend it helping the 90 percent of the kids that we can help  If a local school district in Cleveland or anyplace else wants to have a private choice plan like Milwaukee did  let them have at it  I might say the results are highly ambiguous  But I want to get out there and give a better education opportunity to all of our children and that's why I vetoed the budget you passed with $30 billion in education cuts  It was wrong  and my plan for the future is better LEHRER: Senator Dole  at the Republican convention you said the following and I quote  it is demeaning to the nation that within the Clinton Administration a core of the elite who never grew up  never did anything real  never sacrificed  never suffered  and never learned should have the power to fund with your earnings their dubious and self serving schemes  end quote  w hom precisely and what precisely did you have in mind DOLE: I had precisely in mind a lot of the people that were in the w hite House and other agencies who've never been had any experience  who came to w ashington without any experience  they all were very liberal  of course  or they wouldn't be in the administration  And their idea was that they knew what was best for the American people Now  I feel very strongly about a lot of things  I feel strongly about education  I want to help young people have an education  just as I had an education after w orld w ar II with the GI bill of Rights  w e've had millions of young men and women in subsequent subsequent wars change the face of the nation because the government helped with their education Now the reason they don't have  The reason the President can't support this is pretty obvious  It's not taking anything away from schools  it's new money  It's not being taken away from anybody else  except we'll downsize the Department of Education  But this is a very liberal administration  This is an administration that gave you the big tax cut  This administration tried to take over healthcare and impose a governmental system  This is the administration that fought regulatory reform that is putting a lot of small businessmen and small businesswomen out of business  This is the administration that fought the balanced budget amendment and vetoed a balanced budget and vetoed welfare reform twice  and the list goes on and on and on  that's what I had in mind I want people in my administration and will have people in my administration who understand America  There won't be 10 millionaires and 14 lawyers in the cabinet  There will be people with experience and people who understand America and people who've made it and know the hard knocks in life CLINTON: w hen Senator Dole made that remark about all the elitists  all the young elitists in the administration  one of the young men who works for me who grew up in a house trailer looked at me and said  Mr  President  I know how you grew up  who is he talking about  And you know this liberal charge  that's what their party always drags out when they get in a tight race  It's sort of their golden oldie  you know  It's a record they think they can play that everybody loves to hear  And I just don't think that dog will hunt this time The American people should make up their own mind  Here's the record: w e cut deficit four years in a row for the first time before the Civil w ar    I mean  before w orld w ar II  and maybe before the Civil w ar  too  w e've got ten and a half million new jobs; we've got record numbers of those new small businesses  w e've made every one of them eligible for a tax cut  w e've got declining crime rates  two million fewer people on welfare rolls before welfare reform passed  and a 50 percent increase in child support and a crime bill with 60 death penalties and 100 000 police and the assault weapons ban  The American people can make up their mind about whether that's a liberal record or a record that's good for America  Liberal  conservative  you put whatever label you want on it DOLE: w ell  I think it's pretty liberal  I'll put that label on it  You take a look at all the programs you've advocated  Mr  President  Thank goodness we had a Republican Congress there  The first thing you did when you came into office was set up the stimulus package  said we've got a little pork we want to scatter around America  $16 billion  And even some in your own party couldn't buy that I remember talking by the telephone  I'm not even certain you were too excited about that  I won't  I never repeat what I've talked to the President about  In any event  we saved the taxpayers $16 billion  And then came some other program  and then came healthcare  and then came the tax increase and a lot of these things stopped in 1994 because then the Congress changed  and I think we've done a good job LEHRER: Mr  President  if you're not a liberal  describe your political philosophy CLINTON: I believe that the purpose of politics is to give people the tools to make the most of their own lives; to reinforce the values of opportunity and responsibility  and to build a sense of community so we're all working together  I don't believe in discrimination  I believe you can protect the environment and grow the economy  I believe that we have to do these things with a government that's smaller and less bureaucratic  but that we have to do them nonetheless It's inconvenient for Senator Dole  but the truth is I've reduced the size of government more than my Republican predecessors  And I did stop them  I admit that  I sure stopped their budget  Their budget cut enforcement for the Environmental Protection Agency by a third  It cut funds to clean up toxic waste dumps with 10 million of our kids still living within four miles of a toxic waste dump  by a third  It ended the principle that the polluters should pay for those toxic waste dumps unless it was very recent  Their budget weakened our support for education  $30 billion  even cut funds for scholarships and college loans  Their budget cut $270 billion in Medicare and  finally  their budget withdrew the national guarantee of healthcare to poor children  families with children with handicaps  the elderly in nursing homes  poor pregnant women  It was wrong for the country and calling it conservative won't make it right  It was a bad decision for America and would have been bad for our future if I hadn't stopped it DOLE: w ell  the President can define himself in any way he wants  but I think we have to look at the record  Go back to the time he was  what  Texas director for George McGovern  George McGovern is a friend of mine  so I don't mean  but he was a liberal  proud liberal  I've just finished reading a book  I think it's called    what is it called  what is it  The Demise of the Democratic Party by Ronald Cardash (ph) or something talking about all the liberal influences in the administration  w hether it's organized labor or whether it's the Hollywood elite or whether some of the media elite or whether it's the labor unions or whatever  And so I think you take a look at it  The bottom line is this: I think the American people  thought he'd recite all these bills and all these things  they want to know what's going to happen to them  They've all got a lot of anxieties out there  Did anybody complain when you raised taxes  Did anybody go out and ask the people  how are you going to pay the extra money  That's why we want an economic package  w e want the government to pinch their pennies for a change instead of the people pinching their pennies  That's what our message is to the people watching  Not all this back and forth  you voted this way  you voted that way  we want a better America as we go into the next century CLINTON: The way you get a better America is to balance the budget and protect Medicare  Medicaid  education and the environment; to give a targeted tax cut    and let me talk about the education tax cut    to let people have a $10 000 deduction for the cost of college tuition in any year  any kind of college tuition; to give families a tax credit  a dollar for dollar reduction in their taxes for the cost of a typical community college so we can open that to everybody  And then to let people save in an IRA and withdraw from it without a tax penalty for education  home buying or medical expenses  that's the right way to go into the 21st Century  balance the budget and cut taxes  not balloon with this $550 billion tax scheme LEHRER: Senator Dole  we've talked mostly now about differences between the two of you that relate to policy issues and that sort of thing  Are there also significant differences in the more personal area that are relevant to this election DOLE: Let me say first  on the President's promise for another tax cut  I mean  I've told people as I've traveled around  all of you that got the tax cut he promised last time  vote for him in '96 and not many hands go up  So the question is  would you buy a used election promise from my opponent  The people want economic reform  They're having a hard time making ends meet  You've got one parent working for the government  the other parent working for the family  This is important business  This is about getting the economy moving again  This is about American jobs and opportunities  It's about the government  as I said before  pinching its pennies for a change instead of the poor taxpayer  w hen they raise your taxes nobody runs around asking people where are you going to get the extra money  I think the government can do better  Are there personal differences LEHRER: That are relevant to this DOLE: w ell  my blood pressure is lower  my weight  my cholesterol  but I will not make health an issue in this campaign  So I think he's a bit taller than I am  But I think there are personal differences  I mean  I'm not I don't like to get into personal matters  As far as I'm concerned  this is a campaign about issues  It's about my vision for America and about his liberal vision for America  And not about personal things  You know  I think his liberal vision is a thing of the past  I know he wants to disown it  I wouldn't want to be a liberal either  Mr  President  but you're stuck with it because that's your record  that's your record in Arkansas: The biggest tax increase in history  The biggest crime increase in history  the biggest drug increase in history in Arkansas LEHRER: Mr  President CLINTON: w ell  just for the record  when I was governor we had the lowest    second lowest tax burden of any state in the country  the highest job growth rate of any state when I ran for president and were widely recognized for a lot of other advances But the important thing is  what are we going to do now  I think a targeted tax cut is better for our future  targeted to education and child rearing  with the rest of the education plan  hooking up all of our classrooms to the Internet by the year 2000  Making sure we've got an army of reading volunteers  trained people to teach with parents and teachers so that our eight year olds can learn to read  Investing in our environment  Cleaning up two thirds of the worst toxic waste dumps  Those plans are better than this $550 billion tax scheme Now  remember  folks  even Senator Dole's campaign co chair here  Senator D'Amato  says he's got to cut Medicare to pay for this  Everybody who's looked at it  500 economists  seven Nobel prize winners  say it's bad for the economy  It's going to blow a hole in the deficit It's going to raise taxes on nine million people and require bigger cuts than the one I vetoed  Our plan is better  it will take us into the future with a growing economy and healthier families DOLE: w ell  I'm really encouraged to know of your renewed friendship with Al D'Amato  and I know he appreciates it  You didn't even have tax cuts in your budget  Mr  President  the first two years you were president  It wasn't until we had a Republican Congress you even thought about  you talked about tax cuts  Getting back to personal differences  I think  Jim  if you are a little more specific  but I think the President could clarify one thing tonight and that's the question of pardons  I know you talked about it on the Jim  with Jim Lehrer on the PBS show  And I've never discussed w hitewater  as I've told you personally  I'm not discussing w hitewater now  But I am discussing the power the President has to grant pardons  And hopefully in the next segment you could lay that to rest LEHRER: Mr  President CLINTON: w ell  first of all  you know  he made that remark about Senator D'Amato  He's arranged for me to spend a lot more time with Senator D'Amato in the last couple years so I'm more familiar with his comments than I used to be  Let me say what I've said already about this pardon issue  This is an issue they've brought up  It's under  there's been no consideration of it  no discussion of it  I will tell you this: I will not give anyone special treatment and I will strictly adhere to the law  And that is what every president has done  as far as I know  in the past but what every other president's has done  This is something I take seriously and that's my position DOLE: But it seems to me the president shouldn't have any comment at all  Particularly where it's someone where you've had business dealings  I mean  you may be sending a signal  I don't know  I'm not questioning anybody But as a President of the United States  when somebody asks you about pardons  you say no comment  period  And I think he made a mistake  And I think when you make a mistake  you say I made a mistake  But apparently his position hasn't changed  If there are other specific areas  but beyond that I haven't gotten into any of these things  as the President knows  w e've had that discussion  And again I know Senator D'Amato I think may have had a hearing or two on w hitewater  I can't remember  but he's not my general chairman  he's a friend of mine  And so is Senator Kennedy a friend of yours CLINTON: You bet DOLE: I remember one day on the floor I said now  gentlemen  let me tax your memories  and Kennedy jumped up and said  why haven't we thought of that before  You know  so one of your liberal friends CLINTON: Thank you LEHRER: Mr  President  30 seconds CLINTON: No comment DOLE: w hat's the subject matter LEHRER: Senator Dole  if you could single out one thing that you would like for the voters to have in their mind about President Clinton on a policy matter or a personal matter  what would it be  Something to know about him  understand it and appreciate it DOLE: See  if I say anything it's going to be misconstrued  I don't think there is even a race between the two  it's about our vision for America I happen to like President Clinton personally  I'm addressing him all evening as Mr  President  I said in 1992 he didn't extend that courtesy to President Bush  But I respect the presidency  I've served under a number of presidents  They all have their strengths and they all have their weaknesses  So I'd rather talk about my strengths  And I think I have my strengths and I think the best thing going for Bob Dole is that Bob Dole keeps his word  It's a question between trust and fear  and I would say  I think  Mr  President  about all you've got going in this campaign is fear You're spending millions and millions of dollars in negative ads frightening senior citizens  I know this to be a fact because I had one tell me last week  Senator don't cut my Medicare  I'm trying to save your Medicare  just as I rescued Social Security with a bipartisan commission  I have relatives on Medicare  I used to sign welfare checks for my grandparents  I know all about poverty and all about need and all about taking care of people  and that's been my career in the United States Senate And I'll keep my word on the economic package  If I couldn't cut taxes and balance the budget the same time  I wouldn't look at you in the eye in your living room or wherever you might be and say that this is good for America  People will tell you who served with Bob Dole  agree or disagree  he kept his word  That's what this race is all about CLINTON: I'd like the American people to know that I have worked very hard to be on their side  And to move this country forward and we're better off than we were four years ago  But the most important thing is my plan for the 21st Century is a better plan  A targeted tax cut  a real commitment to educational reform  A deep commitment to making welfare reform work with incentives to the private sector to move people from welfare to work  Now we have to create those jobs  now that we're requiring people to go do work A commitment to continuing step by step healthcare reform with the next step helping people who are between jobs to access healthcare and not lose it just because they are out of work for a while  A commitment to grow the economy while protecting the environment  That's what I'd like them to know about me; that I've gotten up every day and worked for the American people and worked so that their children could have their dreams come true And I believe we've got the results to show we're on the right track  The most important thing is  I believe we've got the right ideas for the future  And I like  I like Senator Dole  you can probably tell we like each other  w e just see the world in different ways  And you folks out there are going to have to choose who you think is right DOLE: w ell  I'd say the first homeless bill in the Senate was the Dole Byrd Byrd Dole bill  I can't remember who was in control then  I remember working with Senator Ribicoff from Connecticut on the Hospice program  w e now have 2500 hospices  As I said  I've worked all my life when I was in the Congress  I left on June 11th because I wanted the American people to know that I was willing to give up something President Clinton ran for governor in 1990 and said he's going to fill out his term  but he didn't  He's president so I guess it's a little better deal  But I wanted the American people to know I was willing to give up something  I wasn't just getting more power and more power  So I rolled the dice  I put my career on the line because I really believe the future of America is on the line w e can give you all these numbers  they don't mean a thing  If you are out of work  you have nothing to eat or you can't have medical care  or you're holding a crack baby in your arms right now  what do you do next  You know  America's best days are ahead of us  I've seen the tough times  I know they can be better and I'll lead America to a brighter future LEHRER: Mr  President  what do you say to Senator Dole's point that this election is about keeping one's word CLINTON: Let's look at that  w hen I ran for president  I said we'd cut the deficit in half in four years; we cut it by 60 percent  I said that our economic plan would produce eight million jobs  we have ten and a half million new jobs  w e're number one in autos again  record numbers of new small businesses  I said we'd put  pass a crime bill that would put 100 000 police on the street  ban assault weapons  and deal with the problems that ought to be dealt with with capital punishment  including capital punishment for drug kingpins  and we did that I said we would change the way welfare works  and even before the bill passed we'd moved nearly two million people from welfare to work  working with states and communities  I said we'd get tougher with child support and child support enforcement's up 50 percent  I said that I would work for tax relief for middle class Americans  The deficit was bigger than I thought it was going to be  I think they're better off  all of us are  that we got the interest rates down and the deficit down Republicans talk about it  but we're the first the first administration in anybody's lifetime looking at this program to bring that deficit down four years in a row  w e still gave tax cuts to 15 million working Americans  and now I've got a plan that's been out there for two years  it could have been passed already  but instead the Republicans shut the government down to try to force their budget and their plan on me  and I couldn't take that  But we'll get the rest of that tax relief  And so I think when you look at those results  you know the plan I've laid out for the future has a very good chance of being enacted if you'll give me a chance to build that bridge to the 21st Century LEHRER: Senator DOLE: w ell  there he goes again  that line has been used before  I mean  exaggerating all the things that he did  He didn't do all these things  Let's take all these four years in a row  He came in with a high growth rate  the 1990 budget agreement  which some  you know  didn't like  had some very tough cost controls  put a lot of pressure on Congress  The S &amp; L crisis was over  they're starting to sell assets  all that money was coming in  And he cut defense an extra $60 billion  threw a lot of people out of work He talks about a smaller government  There are actually more people in government except for people in defense related jobs  They're gone  The government's bigger than it was when President Kennedy was around  even though he says it's not  In addition  Republican Congress cut $53 billion  So let's just  let's give credit where credit is due  Governor Engler of Michigan cut taxes 21 times  created a lot of new jobs  So did Governor Thompson  so did Governor Rowland  A lot of people ought to deserve credit  Mr  President  w hen I'm President of the United States we're going to have a governors' council and we're going to work directly with the governors to get power back to the people and back to the states CLINTON: I think a lot of people deserve credit and I've tried to give it to them  But I believe that my plan is better than Senator Dole's ill advised $550 billion scheme which I'll say again will blow a hole in the deficit  Our plan will balance the budget  grow the economy  preserve the environment  and invest in education  w e have the right approach for the future and looks at the results  It is not midnight in America  Senator  w e are better off than we were four years ago LEHRER: All right  That's the last question  the last answer  Let's go now to the closing statements  Mr  President  you're first  Two minutes CLINTON: w ell  first  Jim  let me thank you and thank you  Senator Dole  and thank you  ladies and gentlemen  all of you listening tonight for the chance you've given us to appear I want to say in the beginning that I am profoundly grateful for the chance that you have given me to serve as president for the last four years  I never could have dreamed anything like this would come my way in life  and I've done my best to be faithful to the charge you've given me I'm proud of the fact that America is stronger and more prosperous and more secure than we were four years ago  And I'm glad we're going in the right direction  And I've done my best tonight to lay out my plans for going forward to an even better future in the next century  I'd like to leave you with the thought that the things I do as president are basically driven by the people whose lives I have seen affected by what does or doesn't happen in this country  The auto worker in Toledo who was unemployed when I was elected and now has a great job because we're number one in auto production again  All the people I've met who used to be on welfare who are now working and raising their children  And I think what others could do for our country and themselves if we did the welfare reform thing in the proper way  I think of the man who grabbed me by the shoulder once with tears in his eyes and said his daughter was dying of cancer and he thanked me for giving him a chance to spend some time with her without losing his job because of the Family and Medical Leave Act  I think of all the people I grew up with and went to school with and who I stay in touch with and who nerve let me forget how what we do in w ashington affects all of you out there in America  Folks  we can build that bridge to the 21st Century  big enough and strong enough for all of us to walk across  and I hope you will help me build it LEHRER: Senator Dole  your closing statement  sir DOLE: Thank you  Jim; thank you  Mr  President; thank everyone for watching and listening I want to address my remarks to the young people of America  because they're the ones that are going to spend most of their life in the 21st Century  They're the ones who have the challenges and they are people out there making predictions that it's not going to be the same  You're not going to have the opportunities; there are going to be more deficits  more drugs  more crime  and less confidence in the American people  And that's what you're faced with  the parents are faced with  and the grand parents are faced with  It's important  it's their future  And I would say to those I know there are more young people experimenting with drugs today than ever before; drug use has gone up  And if you care about the future of America  if you care about your future  just don't do it  And I know that I'm someone older than you  But I've had my anxious moments in my life  I've learned to feed myself and to walk and to dress  I'm standing here as proof that in America the possibilities are unlimited  I know who I am  and I know where I'm from  and I know where I want to take America  w e are the greatest country on the face of the earth  w e do more good things for more people in our communities  our neighborhoods  than anywhere that I know of  This is important business  This election is important  I ask for your support  I ask for your help  And if you really want to get involved  just tap into my home page  www DoleKemp96 org  Thank you  God bless America Transcription by: AM Court

       " 'September 25  1988 Debate TranscriptSeptember 25  1988The First Bush Dukakis Presidential DebateLEHRER: Good evening  On behalf of the Commission on Presidential Debates I am pleased to welcome you to this first presidential debate of the 1988 campaign  I\\'m Jim Lehrer of the McNeil Lehrer News Hour  My colleagues on the panel are John Mashek of The Atlanta Journal Constitution; Ann Groer of The Orlando Sentinel; and Peter Jennings of ABC News  For the next 90 minutes we will be questioning the candidates for president of the United States following a format designed and agreed to by representatives of the two candidates  The candidates are Vice President George Bush  the Republican nominee; Governor Michael Dukakis  the Democratic nominee (Applause)LEHRER: Our questions this evening will be about equally divided between foreign and domestic policy matters  The first question by agreement between the two candidates goes to Vice President Bush  It is a domestic question  You have two minutes for an answer  sir  The polls say the number one domestic issue to a majority of voters is drugs  w hat is there about these times that drives or draws so many Americans to use drugs BUSH: I think we\\'ve seen a deterioration of values  I think for a while as a nation we condoned those things we should have condemned  For a while  as I recall  it even seems to me that there was talk of legalizing or decriminalizing marijuana and other drugs  and I think that\\'s all wrong  So we\\'ve seen a deterioration in values  and one of the things that I think we should do about it in terms of cause is to instill values into the young people in our schools  w e got away  we got into this feeling that value  free education was the thing  And I don\\'t believe that at all I do believe there are fundamental rights and wrongs as far as use  And  of course  as far as the how we make it better  yes  we can do better on interdiction  But we\\'ve got to do a lot better on education  and we have to do  be tougher on those who commit crimes  w e\\'ve got to get after the users more  w e have to change this whole culture  You know  I saw a movie   \"Crocodile Dundee \" And I saw the cocaine scene treated with humor  as though this was a humorous little incident  And it\\'s bad  Everybody ought to be in this thing  Entertainment industry  people involved in the schools  education  And it isn\\'t a Republican or a Democrat or a liberal problem  But we have got to instill values in these young people  And I have put forward a many point drug program that includes what I would do as president of the United States; in terms of doing better on interdiction; and in terms of better in the neighborhoods  But I think we\\'re all in this together  and my plea to the American people is values in the schools LEHRER: Governor  you have one minute to respond DUKAKIS: I agree with Mr  Bush that values are important  But it\\'s important that our leaders demonstrate those values from the top  That means those of us who are elected to positions of political leadership have to reflect those values ourselves  Here we are with a government that\\'s been dealing with a drug running Panamanian dictator  w e\\'ve been dealing with him; he\\'s been dealing drugs to our kids  Governors like me and others have been trying to deal with the consequences  I remember being in a high school in my own state as we were organizing something we call the Governor\\'s Alliance Against Drugs  and a young 16 year old girl coming up to me  desperate  addicted  dependent  saying  Governor  I need help  w e\\'re providing that young woman with help  But I want to be a president of the United States who makes sure that we never again do business with a drug running Panamanian dictator  that we never again funnel aid to the contras through convicted drug dealers  Values begin at the top  in the w hite House  Those are the values I want to bring to the presidency and to the w hite House beginning in January of 1989 LEHRER: Governor  a follow up question  You have two minutes to answer it  Are you suggesting  sir  that President Reagan is one of the causes of the drug problem in this country DUKAKIS: I\\'m saying that those of us who are elected to positions of political leadership  Jim  have a special responsibility  not only to come up with programs  and I have outlined in detail the very important  very strong program of enforcement as well as drug education prevention  And Mr  Bush is right   the two go hand in hand  But if our government itself is doing business with people who we know are engaged in drug profiteering and drug trafficking  if we don\\'t understand that that sends out a very  very bad message to our young people  it\\'s a little difficult for me to understand just how we can reach out to that youngster that I talked about and to young people like her all over the country  and say to them we want to help you  Now  I\\'ve outlined in great detail a program for being tough on enforcement at home and abroad  doubling the number of drug enforcement agents  having a hemispheric summit soon after the 20th of January when we bring our democratic neighbors and allies together here in this hemisphere and go to work together  But we also have to take demand seriously  You know  we have five percent of the world\\'s population in this country  w e\\'re consuming 50 percent of the world\\'s cocaine  Doing better in the neighborhoods  But I think we\\'re all in this together  and my plea to the American people is values in the schools LEHRER: Governor  you have one minute to respond DUKAKIS: I agree with Mr  Bush that values are important  But it\\'s important that our leaders demonstrate those values from the top  That means those of us who are elected to positions of political leadership have to reflect those values ourselves  Here we are with a government that\\'s been dealing with a drug running Panamanian dictator  w e\\'ve been dealing with him; he\\'s been dealing drugs to our kids  Governors like me and others have been trying to deal with the consequences  I remember being in a high school in my own state as we were organizing something we call the Governor\\'s Alliance Against Drugs  and a young 16 year old girl coming up to me  desperate  addicted  dependent  saying  Governor  I need help  w e\\'re providing that young woman with help  But I want to be a president of the United States who makes sure that we never again do business with a drug running Panamanian dictator  that we never again funnel aid to the contras through convicted drug dealers  Values begin at the top  in the w hite House  Those are the values I want to bring to the presidency and to the w hite House beginning in January of 1989 LEHRER: Governor  a follow up question  You have two minutes to answer it  Are you suggesting  sir  that President Reagan is one of the causes of the drug problem in this country DUKAKIS: I\\'m saying that those of us who are elected to positions of political leadership  Jim  have a special responsibility  not only to come up with programs  and I have outlined in detail the very important  very strong program of enforcement as well as drug education prevention  And Mr  Bush is right   the two go hand in hand  But if our government itself is doing

bring our democratic neighbors and allies together here in this hemisphere and go to work together  But we also have to take demand seriously  You know  we have five percent of the world\\'s population in this country  w e\\'re consuming 50 percent of the world\\'s cocaine  And in my state I\\'m proud to say we\\'ve organized a drug education and prevention program which the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration says is a model for the country  w e\\'re helping youngsters; we\\'re reaching out to them  And we\\'re beginning with drug education and prevention beginning in the early elementary grades in every elementary school in our state  and that\\'s the kind of effort we need in every elementary school in the United States of America  And we\\'ve got to begin early  in the first  second and third grade  before our youngsters begin to experiment with these very  very dangerous substances  I guess the question I would ask of Mr  Bush is how we instill those values  how we create this environment for the drug free schools that we want in this country  If he or representatives of the administration are either with or involving people like Noriega in our foreign policy  or don\\'t pursue that connection in a way that makes it possible for us to cut it off and to be an example to our kids all over the country LEHRER: A minute to rebut  Mr  Vice President BUSH: w ell  the other day my opponent was given a briefing by the CIA  I asked for and received the same briefing  I am very careful in public life about dealing with classified information  And what I\\'m about to say is unclassified  Seven administrations were dealing with Mr  Noriega  It was the Reagan Bush administration that brought this man to justice  And as the governor of Massachusetts knows  there was no evidence that governor   that Mr  Noriega was involved in drugs  no hard evidence until we indicted him  And so I think it\\'s about time we get this Noriega matter in perspective  Panama is a friendly country  I went down there and talked to the president of Panama about cleaning up their money laundering  and Mr  Noriega was there  but there was no evidence at that time  and when the evidence was there  we indicted him  And we want to bring him to justice  And so call off all those pickets out there that are trying to tear down seven different administrations LEHRER: All right  the next question will be asked by John Mashek  It goes to Governor Dukakis  and you\\'ll have two minutes to answer MASHEK: Governor Dukakis  another troublesome issue for voters this year is the bulging federal deficit  In a Dukakis administration  you say taxes will be raised only as a last resort  w ould you identify for us then please three specific programs that you are willing to cut to bring that deficit down DUKAKIS: Yes  I\\'ve been very specific about those  John  And let me lay out for you my own strategy for bring that deficit down  because as a chief executive that\\'s balanced ten budgets in a row  I\\'ve had to make those tough decisions and those tough choices  First  I\\'ve suggested that there are certain weapons systems which we don\\'t need and we can\\'t afford  Mr  Bush has been critical of me for that  but I think those are the kinds of tough choices you have to make  I\\'ve also suggested that there are weapons systems that we should proceed on  and I\\'ve outlined those in detail  Secondly  we\\'ve got to invest in economic growth in this country  in every part of this country  Building that kind of growth expands revenues and helps to bring down that deficit  Thirdly  we have to bring interest rates down  and we will as we come up with a good  solid plan with the Congress for bringing that deficit down  And  finally  we\\'ve got to go out there and collect billions and billions of dollars in taxes owed that aren\\'t being paid to this country  It\\'s very unfair to the average taxpayer who pays his taxes and pays them on time to permit these monies to go uncollected  I\\'ve also suggested that on the domestic side there are areas where we can make some cuts  w e ought to be able to come up with an agricultural policy in this country that gives our farm families a fair price and a decent future without spending $20 25 billion a year  which is what we\\'ve been doing under this administration  w e can help people to live better lives  and at the same time save money by helping hundreds of thousands of families on welfare to get off or welfare  and to become productive citizens again  The thing I don\\'t understand about Mr  Bush\\'s approach to this is how he could possibly be serious about bringing that deficit down given what he says he wants to do  He seems to want to spend a great deal of money on just about every weapon system; he says he\\'s against new taxes  although he\\'s broken that pledge at least times in the last year that I know of; he wants to give the wealthiest taxpayers in this country a five year  $40 billion tax break  He also wants to spend a lot of money on additional programs  If he keeps this up  he\\'s going to be the Joe Isuzu of American politics (Laughter)DUKAKIS: But I hope you won\\'t take my five seconds away from me  I will say this  LEHRER: Your two minutes is up  Governor DUKAKIS: If he\\'s serious about what he\\'s saying  then the only place he can go to balance that budget is to raid the Social Security Trust Fund  and he tried that in 1985  and I think he\\'s going to try it again LEHRER: You have a minute to rebut BUSH: Is this the time to unleash our one liners  That answer was about as clear as Boston harbor (Laughter)BUSH: Let me help the governor  There are so many things there  I don\\'t quite know where to begin  w hen you cut capital gains  you put people to work  John Kennedy proposed cutting capital gains  Paul Tsongas  a liberal senator from Massachusetts said the dumbest thing I did was to oppose the capital gains cut  It\\'s not going to cost the government money  It\\'s going to increase revenues to the federal government  and it\\'s going to create jobs  So that\\'s one of the things that I think makes a big difference between us  Massachusetts doesn\\'t have an enormous defense budget  but nevertheless  the governor raised taxes five different times  That happens to be a fact  And so let\\'s kind of stay on the issue  and I have made a specific proposal for what I call a flexible freeze  And it permits   economists on the East Coast and w est think it\\'s good   it permits the president to sort out the priorities  and we continue to grow because I will not raise taxes LEHRER: Your time is up  too  A follow up  John MASHEK: Mr  Vice President  you have vowed not to raise taxes of any kind during your administration and at the same time you\\'ve proposed this capital gains cut  you\\'ve proposed more incentive breaks for the oil industry  You\\'ve suggested new spending programs and even some Republicans say the flexible freeze you just spoke about will hardly make a dent in the deficit  Is the deficit no longer really a concern of yours  the Republican Party or the taxpayers BUSH: I think it\\'s the Republican Party and my concern to bring it down  And presidential leadership that I want to provide in this area will bring it down  but we\\'ve got to get the Democrats   Congress under control  They do all the spending  they appropriate every dime and tell us how to spend every dime  I\\'d like to ask the Governor to join in getting for the president what 43 governors have  the line item veto  He has to operate in Massachusetts under a balanced budget proviso  I would like a balanced budget amendment  But the dynamics of the economy   we cut the taxes and revenues are up by 25 percent in three years  So the problem is   it\\'s not that the working is being taxed too little or the person working out   the woman working in some factory being taxed too little  It is that we are continuing to spend too much  So  my formula says grow at the rate of inflation  Permit the president to set the priorities on where we do the spending  And remember the Federal deficit has come down $70 billion in one year  in 1987  And if we   and the   actually this year Congress is doing a little better in controlling the growth of spending  Spending was only up something like 4 percent  So  it isn\\'t that we\\'re taking too little   from taxpayer   we\\'re spending too much still  And the formula I\\'ve given you works  we\\'ve put it through a good economic model  we\\'ve got good economists on the w est Coast  Michael Boskin and Marty Feldstein up there who\\'s a very respected economist in the   Massachusetts  And they agree  that if we can do what I\\'ve said  we can get it down without going and socking the American taxpayer once again  Capital gains  one more point on that  please let\\'s learn from history  A capital gains differential will increase jobs  increase risk taking  increase revenues to the Federal Government LEHRER: Governor  you have a minute to rebut DUKAKIS: w ell  I hope all of those Americans out there who are watching us  listening to us and trying to make up their mind about which one of us ought to be president of the United States listen to the Vice President very carefully  w hat he\\'s proposing after over a trillion in new debt which has been added in the Federal debt in the course of the past eight years  an IOU our children and grandchildren will be paying for years  is a tax cut for the wealthiest one percent of the people in this country  an average of about $30 000 that we\\'re going to give to people making $200 000 a year  w hy that\\'s more than the average teacher makes  w e\\'ve had enough of that  ladies and gentlemen  w e\\'ve run up more debt in the last eight years than under all the presidents from George w ashington to Jimmy Carter combined  It\\'s time for a chief executive who can make tough choices  can work with the Congress  can get that deficit down and begin to build a strong fiscal foundation under this country LEHRER: All right  the next question will be asked by Anne Groer and it will go the Vice President  You have two minutes to answer  sir GROER: Mr  Vice President  you\\'ve said you want a kinder  gentler presidency  one that helps the less fortunate  Today  37 million Americans including many working families with aging parents and young children cannot afford any health insurance  but earn too much to qualify for Medicaid  w hat will you do to provide protection for them and how will you pay for it BUSH: One thing I will not do is sock every business in the country and  thus  throw some people out of work  I want to keep this economic recovery going  More Americans at work today than any time in history  a greater percentage of the work force  w hat I will do is permit people to buy into Medicaid  I believe that\\'s the answer  I am proud to have been part of an administration that past the first catastrophic health bill  And in that there are some Medicaid provisions that will be very helpful to the very kind of people we\\'re talking about here  But we\\'ve got to keep going forward without killing off the engine and throwing people out of work  So  the answer lies  it seems to me  in full enforcement of the catastrophic program  It lies to me in flexibility in Medicaid so people at the lowest end can buy in there and get their needs covered and then it also   I do not want to see us mandate across the board that every company has to do this  because I really think that marginal operators are going to go say  \"w e can\\'t make it \" And I think then you\\'re going to see that people are put out of work  All these programs   and this cost on his   is   was   I saw an estimate  I\\'d love to know what he thinks  $35   $40 billion   and it seems to me that somebody pays that  There isn\\'t any such thing as something free out there  It either gets passed along as increased prices or it gets passed along by people being put out of work so the business can continue to compete  So  I think we ought to do it in the Medicaid system  I think we ought to do it by full enforcement of the catastrophic health insurance  I think we ought to do it by everybody doing what they can do out of conscience  It\\'s a terrible problems in terms of flexibility on private insurance  But I just don\\'t want to mandate it and risk putting this   setting the recovery back LEHRER: A rebuttal  Governor DUKAKIS: But  George  that\\'s no answer BUSH: You don\\'t like the answer  but it\\'s an answer DUKAKIS: w ell  no  it\\'s no answer to those 37 million people  most of them members of working families who don\\'t have a dime of health insurance and don\\'t know how to pay the bills if their kids get sick at night  I was in Houston on Tuesday meeting with a group of good citizens  working citizens  All of them with little or no health insurance  One of them was a father who had been laid off a few months ago and lost his health insurance  Has an 11 year old son and can\\'t let that son compete in sports and Little League  because he\\'s afraid he\\'s going to get hurt and he won\\'t be able to provide health insurance to pay those bills  My state just became the only state in the nation to provide for universal health care and we did it with the support of the business community and labor and the health care community and with virtually everybody in the state  The fact of the matter is that employers who today are insuring their employees are paying the freight  because they\\'re paying for those who aren\\'t  And I think it\\'s time that when you got a job in this country it came with health insurance  That\\'s the way we\\'re going to provide basic health security for all of the citizens of this country of ours LEHRER: Follow up  Anne GROER: Yes  Since your Massachusetts health plan has been attacked by the Vice President and you have defended it in this way  I would like to move on to perhaps one of the most costly medical catastrophes facing Americans today and that is AIDS  In   at the end of September  the thousands of AIDS patients will lose their access to AZT  which is the only Federally approved drug for treatment of the disease  Now  I\\'d like to now  sir  if   what your position is on extending that and what it is you think the government ought to be doing about making AZT and other drugs available to people who are suffering from this disease DUKAKIS: w ell  Anne  let me just say before I answer your question that I didn\\'t know that the Vice President attacked our program in Massachusetts  I hope he hasn\\'t  Because has won the support of a great many people all over the state and I think it\\'s a model for what I hope we can do across the country  But when I proposed my plan this past Tuesday  he or one of his spokesmen called it socialized medicine  The last time the Vice President used that phrase  I suspect he remembers it  don\\'t you  It was in 1964 and that\\'s what he called Medicare  w ell  he was wrong then and he\\'s wrong now  (Applause)LEHRER: If I may interrupt at this point and caution the audience as I did before we went on the air  please hold it down  You\\'re only taking time away from your candidate when you do that  Governor  continue  please DUKAKIS: Let me say this about AIDS  It\\'s the single most important public health crisis  single most important public health emergency we\\'ve had in our lifetimes and I think there are a number of things we have to do including supporting legislation which is now moving through the Congress  which will commit this nation to the resources to find a cure which will provide broad education and prevention  which will provide sensitive and caring treatment for the victims of AIDS  I think we have to demonstrate some flexibility and I think the FDA is attempting to do so now in trying to make it possible for new and experimental drugs to be available to people who are at risk at AIDS and I would hope that we could bring that kind of a policy to bear beginning in January  And I would encourage the current administration to proceed with that kind of flexibility where it\\'s appropriate and where it\\'s done carefully and responsibly  But we have not had the kind of leadership we should have had  In this particular area  I think the Vice President and I are in general agreement on what we have to do  The special Federal commission made good solid recommendations  I think we\\'re both supportive of them and I would strongly lead in that area as I have in my state as Governor LEHRER: Mr  Vice President  a minute of rebuttal BUSH: w ell  we\\'re on the right track  The NIH is doing a good job in research  The Surgeon General is doing a good job in encouraging the proper kind of education  I notice that the Governor did not mention any testing  But we got to have a knowledge base  Testing should be confidential  but we have to have a knowledge  w e can\\'t simply stick our heads in the sands in terms of testing  I\\'m Chairman of the President\\'s Task Force on Regulatory Relief and we are working with the FDA and they have sped up bringing drugs to market that can help  And you got to be careful here  because there\\'s a safety factor  but I think these things   and then also I am one who believes we\\'ve got to go the extra mile in clean   being sure that that blood supply is pure  w e cannot have a lack of confidence in the blood supply when it comes to operations and surgery and things of this nature  So  research  speeding the drugs to market  testing  blood supply are very important elements of this LEHRER: Next question will be asked by Peter Jennings  It goes to the Governor JENNINGS: Good evening  Mr  Vice President  Governor  Governor  one theme that keeps coming up about the way you govern   you\\'ve both mentioned leadership tonight  so I\\'d like to stay with that for a second  The theme that keeps coming up about the way you govern is passionless  technocratic  DUKAKIS: Passionless JENNINGS: Passionless  technocratic  the smartest clerk in the world  Your critics maintain that in the 1960\\'s your public passion was not the war in Vietnam or civil rights  but no fault auto insurance  And they say in the 1970\\'s you played virtually no role in the painful busing crisis in Boston  Given the fact that a president must sometimes lead by sheer inspiration and passion  w e need to know if this is a fair portrait of your governing or if it is a stereotype  And if it isn\\'t fair  give us an example of where you have had that passion and leadership that sometimes a president needs LEHRER: Mr  Vice President  a rebuttal BUSH: w ell  I don\\'t question his passion  I question   and I don\\'t question his concern about the war in Vietnam  He introduced or supported legislation back then that suggested that kids of Massachusetts should be exempt from going overseas in that war  Now  that\\'s a certain passion that in my view it\\'s misguided passion  He   we have a big difference on issues  You see  last year in the primary  he expressed his passion  He said  \"I am a strong liberal Democrat\"   August  \\'87  Then he said  \"I am a card carrying member of the ACLU \" That was what he said  He is out there on out of the mainstream  He is very passionate  My argument with the governor is  do we want this country to go that far left  And I wish we had time to let me explain  But I salute him for his passion  w e just have a big difference on where this country should be led  and in what direction it ought to go (Applause)LEHRER: Peter  a question  Question for the vice president  Peter JENNINGS: I\\'d actually like to follow up if I may on this mention you\\'ve made of his card carrying membership in the American Civil Liberties Union  You\\'ve used the phrase \"card carrying\" so many times since Governor Dukakis first acknowledged that he was a card carrying member of the ACLU that some people have come to believe that you\\'ve used it to brand him in some way  to identify him as people were identified in the 1950\\'s as less than patriotic  I\\'d like to know why you keep repeating the phrase  and what\\'s the important issue here  w hat is so wrong with the governor being a member of an organization which has come to the defense of  among other people  Colonel Oliver North BUSH: Nothings wrong with it  But just take a look at the positions of the ACLU  But  Peter  please understand  the liberals do not like me talking about liberal They don\\'t like it when I say that he says he\\'s a card carrying member  Now  if that quote was wrong  he can repudiate it  right here  I\\'ve seen it authoritatively written twice  and if I\\'ve done him an injustice  and he didn\\'t say it  I\\'m very  very sorry  But I don\\'t agree with a lot of   most of the positions of the ACLU  I simply don\\'t want to see the ratings on movies  I don\\'t want my ten year old grandchild to go into an X rated movie  I like those ratings systems  I don\\'t think they\\'re right to try to take the tax exemption away from the Catholic Church  I don\\'t want to see the kiddie pornographic laws repealed; I don\\'t want to see \"under God\" come out from our currency  Now  these are all positions of the ACLU  And I don\\'t agree with them  He has every right to exercise his passion  as what he said  a strong  progressive liberal  I don\\'t agree with that  I come from a different point  And I think I\\'m more in touch with the mainstream of America  They raised the same thing with me on the Pledge of Allegiance  You see  I\\'d have found a way to sign that bill  Governor Thompson of Illinois did  I\\'m not questioning his patriotism  He goes out and says the man is questioning my patriotism  And then all the liberal columnists join in  I am not  I am questioning his judgment on these matters  or where he\\'s coming from He has every right to do it  But I believe that\\'s not what the American people want  and when he said  when he said at the convention  ideology doesn\\'t matter  just competence  he was moving away from his own record  from what his passion has been over the years  And that\\'s all I\\'m trying to do  is put it in focus  And I hope people don\\'t think that I\\'m questioning his patriotism when I say he used his words to describe his participation in that organization LEHRER: Governor  a response DUKAKIS: w ell  I hope this is the first and last time I have to say this  Of course  the vice president is questioning my patriotism  I don\\'t think there\\'s any question about that  and I resent it  I resent it  My parents came to this country as immigrants  They taught me that this was the greatest country in the world  I\\'m in public service because I love this country  I believe in it  And nobody\\'s going to question my patriotism as the vice president has now repeatedly  The fact of the matter is if the Pledge of Allegiance was the acid test of one\\'s patriotism  the vice president\\'s been the presiding officer in the United States Senate for the past seven and a half years  To the best of my knowledge he\\'s never once suggested that a session of the Senate begin with the Pledge of Allegiance (Applause)DUKAKIS: Mr  Bush  I don\\'t question your patriotism  w hen you\\'re attacked for your military record  I immediately said it was inappropriate  it had no place in this campaign  and I rejected it  I would hope that from this point on  we get to the issues that affect the vast majority of Americans  jobs  schools  health care  housing  the environment  Those are the concerns of the people that are watching us tonight  Not labels that we attach to each other  questions about each other\\'s patriotism and loyalty LEHRER: The time is up  governor  Let\\'s go now to John Mashek  again  A question for the vice president MASHEK: Mr  Vice President  in a debate during the Republican primaries  you said most of the nation\\'s homeless are suffering from mental illness  an assertion immediately challenged by one of your rivals  Estimates of the homeless range from a low of 250 000 by the government  to around three million  including working families and their children  w hat commitment are you willing to make tonight to this voiceless segment of our society BUSH: I want to see the McKinney Act fully funded  I believe that that would help in terms of shelter  I want to see   when I talked at our convention about a thousand points of light  I was talking about the enormous numbers of shelters and organizations that help  The governor\\'s wife has been very active in the homeless  My campaign chairman  Secretary Jim Baker\\'s wife  This isn\\'t government  These are people that care  that are trying to give of themselves  The government has a role  It is to fully fund the McKinney Act  There are certain army bases that the act calls for that can be used in certain cases to shelter people when it\\'s rough  And so I think that we\\'re on the right track  I don\\'t see this  incidentally  as a Democrat or a Republican or a liberal or conservative idea  I see an involvement by a thousand points of light  I see the funding that is required  and I hope the Congress will fully fund this bill  They gave it a great deal of conscience and a great deal of work  And we\\'re on the track on this one  But   and I  look  mental   that was a little overstated it  I\\'d say around 30 percent  And I think maybe we could look back over our shoulders and wonder whether it was right to let all those mental patients out  Maybe we need to do a better job in mental clinics to help them  Because there is a major problem there  A lot of them are mentally sick  And we\\'ve got to attend to them  But fully  my short range answer is fully fund that McKinney Act LEHRER: Governor  a response DUKAKIS: w ell  this is another fundamental difference that I have with the vice president  just as I do in the case of health care for 37 million members of working families in this country who don\\'t have health insurance  The problem  Mr  Bush  is that you\\'ve cut back by 90 percent on our commitment to affordable housing for families of low and moderate income  And when you do that  you\\'ve have homeless families  w e didn\\'t have two and a half million  or three million homeless people living on streets and in doorways in this country ten years ago  w e\\'ve got to begin to get back to the business of building and rehabilitating housing for families of low and moderate income in this country; housing for young families that they can look forward some day to buy  w e\\'ve got communities in this country increasingly where our own kids can\\'t afford to live in the communities that they grew up in  That\\'s an essential commitment  And I think the housing community is ready  But it\\'s going to take a president who\\'s committed to housing  who\\'s had experience in building and rehabilitating housing who understands that affordable housing for families of low and moderate income  for young families  first time home buyers  is an essential part of the American dream  And while I\\'m all for the McKinney bill  that  by itself  simply won\\'t do  w e\\'ve got to have a president that can lead on this issue  that can work with the Congress  and I\\'m prepared to do so  This is one of the most important priorities that faces this country LEHRER: John  a question for the governor MASHEK: Governor  you\\'ve mentioned the American dream of home ownership  and it\\'s certainly become an impossible one for many of the young people of our nation who are caught up in this economic squeeze of the middle class  as you\\'ve said so frequently during the campaign  And yet in spite of your answer just a few minutes ago  what promise can you realistically hold out to these people that with the costs of housing going up  and with limited help available from w ashington  are we destined to become a nation of renters DUKAKIS: w ell  I certainly hope not  And it\\'s all a question of what our priorities are  Mr  Bush talked about values  I agree with him  w hat are our values  Isn\\'t providing housing for families of low and moderate income  isn\\'t it making possible for young families  first time home buyers to own their own home some day something that\\'s part of the American dream  I think so  You know  back after w orld w ar II when we had hundreds of thousands of GIs who came back from the war  we didn\\'t sit around  w e went out and built housing  The government was very much involved; so was the housing industry; so was the banking industry; so were housing advocates; so were non profit agencies; so were governors and mayors and people all over this country who believe deeply in home ownership and affordable housing  Now  that\\'s the kind of leadership that I want to provide as president of the United States  This isn\\'t a question of a little charity for the homeless  This is a question of organizing the housing community  I\\'ve talked to bankers and builders and developers  the housing advocates  community development agencies  and they want leadership from w ashington  w ashington  by itself  can\\'t do it all  w e shouldn\\'t expect that  But governors are ready; mayors are ready  Builders and community leaders are ready  It will require some funds  John  And we ought to be prepared to provide those funds  But that  too  will require some choices  Mr  Bush wants to spend billions and trillions on Star w ars  w ell  that\\'s a choice we have to make  isn\\'t it  Do we spend money on that weapon system in the billions and trillions  or is providing some decent and affordable housing for families of this country something that is at least as important and probably more so  Because it\\'s so essential to our economic strength and to our future  Now  that\\'s the kind of presidency I believe in  And simply to say  well  the McKinney bill will do it just doesn\\'t do  w e need a president who will lead on this issue  who has had experience on this issue  It\\'s the kind of priority that will be at the top of our list beginning in January of 1989 LEHRER: A response  Mr  Vice President BUSH: I think the governor is blurring housing and the homeless  Let\\'s talk about housing which the question was  w hen you talk to those bankers  did they discuss where interest rates were when your party controlled the w hite House  Ten days before I took the oath of office as president they were 21 and a half percent  Now  how does that grab you for increasing housing  Housing is up  w e are serving a million more families now  But we\\'re not going to do it in that old Democratic  liberal way of trying to build more bricks and mortars  Go out and take a look at St  Louis at some of that effort  It is wrong  I favor home ownership  I want to see more vouchers  I want to see control of some of these projects  and I want to keep the interest rates down  They\\'re half  now of what they were when we came into office  and with my policy of getting this deficit under control  they\\'ll be a lot less  But if we spend and spend and spend  that is going to wrap up the housing market  and we\\'ll go right back to the days of the misery index and malaise that President Reagan and I have overcome   thank God for the United States on that one LEHRER: All right  the next question is to the governor  Ann Groer will ask it GROER: Governor Dukakis  is there a conflict between your opposition to the death penalty and your support for abortion on demand  even though in the minds of many people  that\\'s also killing DUKAKIS: No  I don\\'t think there is  There are two very different issues here  and they\\'ve got to be dealt with separately  I\\'m opposed to the death penalty  I think everybody knows that  I\\'m also very tough on violent crime  And that\\'s one of the reasons why my state has cut crime by more than any other industrial state in America  It\\'s one of the reasons why we have the lowest murder rate of any industrial state in the country  It\\'s one of the reasons why we have a drug education and prevention program that is reaching out and helping youngsters all over our state  the kind of thing I want to do as president of the United States  You know  the vice president says he wants to impose the death penalty on drug traffickers  and yet his administration has a federal furlough program which is one of the most permissive in the country  which gave last year 7 000 furloughs to drug traffickers and drug pushers  the same people that he says he now wants to execute  The issue of abortion is a very difficult issue  one that I think that we all have to wrestle with  we have to come to terms with  I don\\'t favor abortion  I don\\'t think it\\'s a good thing  I don\\'t think most people do  The question is who makes the decision  And I think it has to be the woman  in the exercise of her own conscience and religious beliefs  that makes that decision LEHRER: Response  Mr  Vice President BUSH: w ell  the Massachusetts furlough program was unique  It was the only one in the nation that furloughed murderers who had not served enough time to be eligible for parole  The federal program doesn\\'t do that  No other state programs do that  And I favor the death penalty  I know it\\'s tough and honest people can disagree  But when a narcotics wrapped up guy goes in and murders a police officer  I think they ought to pay with their life  And I do believe it would be inhibiting  And so I am not going to furlough men like w illie Horton  and I would meet with their  the victims of his last escapade  the rape and the brutalization of the family down there in Maryland  Maryland would not extradite w illie Horton  the man who was furloughed  the murderer  because they didn\\'t want him to be furloughed again  And so we have a fundamental difference on this one  And I think most people know my position on the sanctity of life  I favor adoption  I do not favor abortion LEHRER: Question for the vice president  Ann GROER: Yes  Mr  Vice President  I\\'d like to stay with abortion for just a moment if I might  Over the years you have expressed several positions  while opposing nearly all forms of government payment for it  You now say that you support abortion only in cases of rape  incest  or threat to a mother\\'s life  and you also support a constitutional amendment that if ratified would outlaw most abortions  But if abortions were to become illegal again  do you think that the women who defy the law and have them anyway  as they did before it was okayed by the Supreme Court  and the doctors who perform them should go to jail BUSH: I haven\\'t sorted out the penalties  But I do know  I do know that I oppose abortion  And I favor adoption  And if we can get this law changed  everybody should make the extraordinary effort to take these kids that are unwanted and sometimes aborted  take the   let them come to birth  and then put them in a family where they will be loved  And you see  yes  my position has evolved  And it\\'s continuing to evolve  and it\\'s evolving in favor of life  And I have had a couple of exceptions that I support   rape  incest and the life of the mother  Sometimes people feel a little uncomfortable talking about this  but it\\'s much clearer for me now  As I\\'ve seen abortions sometimes used as a birth control device  for heavens sakes  See the millions of these killings accumulate  and this is one where you can have an honest difference of opinion  w e certainly do  But no  I\\'m for the sanctity of life  and once that illegality is established  then we can come to grips with the penalty side  and of course there\\'s got to be some penalties to enforce the law  whatever they may be LEHRER: Governor DUKAKIS: w ell  I think what the vice president is saying is that he\\'s prepared to brand a woman a criminal for making this decision  It\\'s as simple as that  I don\\'t think it\\'s enough to come before the American people who are watching us tonight and say  well  I haven\\'t sorted it out  This is a very  very difficult and fundamental decision that all of us have to make  And what he is saying  if I understand him correctly  is that he\\'s prepared to brand a woman a criminal for making this choice BUSH: I just  DUKAKIS: Let me finish  Let me simply say that I think it has to be the woman in the exercise of her own conscience and religious beliefs that makes that decision  and I think that\\'s the right approach  the right decision  and I would hope by this time that Mr  Bush had sorted out this issue and come to terms with it as I have  I respect his right to disagree with me  But I think it\\'s important that we have a position  that we take it  and we state it to the American people LEHRER: Peter Jennings  a question for the vice president JENNINGS: Mr  Vice President  I\\'m struck by your discussion of women and the sanctity of life  And it leads me to recall your own phrase  that you are haunted by the lives which children in our inner cities live  Certainly the evidence is compelling  There\\'s an explosion of single parent families  And by any measure  these single parent families  many with unwanted children  are the source of poverty  school drop outs  crime  which many people in the inner city simply feel is out of control  If it haunts you so  why over the eight years of the Reagan Bush administration have so many programs designed to help the inner cities been eliminated or cut BUSH: One of the reasons  and I first would like to know which programs you\\'re talking about  and then we could talk on the merits of the programs  But  you see  my fundamental philosophy is give local and state government as much control as possible  That might be the explanation  if you tell me the program  I do strongly support the w IC program  I think it is good  I think part of the answer to this haunting of these children that are out there and suffering lies in extension of Medicaid  to challenge the states  and maybe we\\'re going to have to enforce more on the states in terms of Medicaid taking care of these  But  Peter  so much of it is  gets into a whole other phase of things  The neighborhood  the kind of environment people are growing up in  and that leads me to the programs I\\'m talking about in terms of education  I think that part of it is the crime infested neighborhoods  and that\\'s why I\\'m a strong believer in trying to control crimes in the neighborhood  why I was so pleased to be endorsed by the policemen on the beat  the Boston Police Department the other day  I think they understand my commitment to helping them in the neighborhoods  And so it\\'s a combination of these things  But do not erode out of the system the thousand points of light  The people that are out there trying to help these kids  the programs like cities and schools  the work that Barbara Bush is doing so people can learn to read in this country and then go on and break this cycle of poverty  I\\'m for Head Start and moving that up  And I\\'ve already made a proposal   and yes  it will cost some money  But I favor that  So these are the combination of things I want  and the fact that I don\\'t think the federal government can endorse a $35 billion program does not mean I have less compassion than the person who endorses such a program LEHRER: Governor DUKAKIS: w ell  I must have been living through a different eight years then the ones the vice president\\'s been living through  because this administration has cut and slashed and cut and slashed programs for children  for nutrition  for the kinds of things that can help these youngsters to live better lives  It\\'s cut federal aid to education; it\\'s cut Pell grants and loans to close the door to college opportunity on youngsters all over this country  And that  too  is a major difference between the vice president and me  Let me just give you one other example  w e have a great many people  hundreds of thousands of people living on public assistance in this country  The 50 governors of this nation have proposed to the Congress that we help those families to get off of welfare  help those youngsters  help their mothers to become independent and self sufficient  It\\'s taken months and months and months to get Mr  Bush and the administration to support that legislation  and they\\'re still resisting  That\\'s the way you help people  Being haunted  a thousand points of light   I don\\'t know what that means  I know what strong political leadership is  I know what\\'s happened over the course of the past eight years  These programs have been cut and slashed and butchered  and they\\'ve hurt kids all over this country LEHRER: A question for the governor  Peter JENNINGS: Governor  the crisis is no less a crisis for you if you are elected president  w here would you get the money to devote to the inner cities which is clearly needed  And can you be specific about the programs not only you\\'d reinstate  but the more imaginative ones that you\\'d begin DUKAKIS: w ell  I said a few minutes ago  Peter  that you could improve the lives of families and youngsters and save money at the same time  w elfare reform is one way to do it  If we invest in job training  in child care for those youngsters  in some extended health benefits so that that mother and her kids don\\'t lose their health benefits when she goes to work  we can help literally hundreds of thousands  if not millions of families  to get off of welfare  to become independent and self sufficient  to be taxpaying citizens  and to improve their lives  the quality of lives  their futures  and the futures of those children That\\'s just one example of how you can save money and improve the quality of life at the same time  In my own state  for example  we now have that universal health care system  which the vice president opposes  I think very unwisely  One of the greatest barriers to opportunity for a family and for those children is the threat that they mat lose their health insurance  Think about that father down there in Houston who has to tell his youngster that he can\\'t play little league ball that he can\\'t go out on the ball field because he\\'s afraid he\\'s going to get hurt And yet  Mr  Bush says well  I don\\'t think we ought to expect business to provide health insurance for their employees  when responsible employers  a majority of employers in this country do and are paying more for their insurance to reimburse hospitals for free care on account of people that are not insured  that have to go to that hospital So these are the ways that you help families  you help youngsters to live better lives  and more decent lives  w ere ready to go to work at the state and local level  all of us  I know the private sector is  People are all over the country  But it takes presidential leadership  It takes a commitment to being involved and the leading  And that\\'s the kind of presidency I want to lead LEHRER: Mr  Vice President BUSH: w hat troubles me is that when I talk of the voluntary sector and a thousand points of light and a thousand different ways to help on these problems  the man has just said he doesn\\'t understand what I\\'m talking about This is the problem I have with the big spending liberals  They think the only way to do it is for the federal government to do it all  The fact happens to be that education spending is up by the federal government; it is up  It is not down But here\\'s the point he misses  The federal government spends seven percent of the total on education  and the rest of the state governments and local governments and the thousand points of lightened I\\'m talking about private schools and private church schools and things of this nature  are putting up 93 percent But the federal spending for education is up  and I want to be the education president  because I want to see us do better  w e\\'re putting more money per child into education  and we are not performing as we should  w e\\'ve gotten away fro values and the fundamentals  And I would like to urge the school superintendents and the others around the country to stand up now and keep us moving forward on a path towards real excellence And we can do it  But itÏ€s not going to be dedicated by some federal bureaucracy in w ashington  D C LEHRER: All right  let\\'s move now to some questions on foreign and national security policy  John Mashek will ask the first question of the governor MASHEK: Governor  the vice president continually refers to your lack of experience  weakness  naivete on foreign policy and national security matters  He says you are prepared to eliminate weapons system that will result in the unilateral disarmament of this country  Is that true DUKAKIS: Of course not  Of course that\\'s a charge that\\'s always made against any governor who runs for the presidency  I think it was one of the things that Mr  Bush said about Mr  Reagan back in 1980  Remember that  George  And yet some of our finest presidents  some of our strongest international leaders were governors Franklin Roosevelt  w oodrow w ilson  Theodore Roosevelt Its not the amount of time you spend in w ashington  It\\'s not the length of your resume  It\\'s your strength  it\\'s your values  it\\'s the quality of the people you pick  It\\'s your understanding of the forces of change that are sweeping the world  and whether or not you\\'re in a position to provide leadership to make those forces of change work for us and not against us The vice president has a long resume  But it didn\\'t stop him from endorsing the sale of arms to the Ayatollah  And we now know that he was not out of the loop; he was in meeting after meeting listening to Secretary Shultz and Secretary w einberger opposing that  and yet he supported it His experience didn\\'t prevent him from participating or involving or in some way being involved in the relationship between this government and Mr  Noriega and drug trafficking in Panama He went to Philippines in the early 80Ï€s and commended Ferdinand Macros for his commitment to democracy  And he continues to support a failed policy in Central America which is getting worse and worse  and which has in fact increased Cuban and Soviet influence in that region So I don\\'t believe that the fact you\\'ve got that long resume or had that experience is the real question  The question is values; the question is strength  the question is your willingness to provide the kind of leadership that must be provided  I\\'m ready to provide that leadership  I want to be the commander in chief of this country  I think it take fresh leadership now  and an understanding of those forces of change to provide the kind of strength that we need  and perhaps the vice president can explain what he was doing when he supported the trading of arms to terrorist nation  and his involvement in Panama and that endorsement of Mr  Macros  But I don\\'t think it\\'s just experience that makes the difference  It\\'s strength; it\\'s values LEHRER: Mr  Vice President BUSH: w ell  I thought the question was about defense  The governor was for a nuclear freeze that would have locked in a thousand Soviet intermediate nuclear force weapons and zero for the w est  And because we didn\\'t listen to the freeze advocates  and strengthen the defense of this country  we now have the first arms control agreement in the nuclear age  Now  we\\'re sitting down and talking to the Soviets about strategic arms  and he wants to do away with the Midgetman and the MX  the modernization or our nuclear capability  That is not the way you deal with the Soviets  I\\'ve met Mr  Gorbachev  Met Mr  Shevardnadze and talked substance with him the other day  These people are tough  But now we have a chance  I few have experience and now how to handle it  but please do not go back to the days when the military was as weak as they could be  when the morale was down  and when we were the laughing stock around the world And now we are back  because we have strengthened the defenses of this country  and believe me  I don\\'t want to see us return to those days As to Ferdinand Marcos  he isn\\'t there any more  It was under our administration that Mrs  Aquino came in  But I\\'ll tell you what I was thinking of  I flew a combat mission  my last one was over Manila  And he was down there fighting against imperialism  And he had just LEHRER: Mr  Vice PresidentBUSH: And he just lifted martial law  And he just called for new elections  And all of those things happened because the Philippines do crave democracy  And out he goes LEHRER: Mr  Vice President  your time is up  John  a question for the vice president MASHEK: Mr  Vice President  the governor has suggested that you\\'ve never met a weapons system that you didn\\'t like or want  Are you prepared to tell the voters one system in this time of tight budgetary restraints and problems at the Pentagon that you\\'d be willing to cut or even eliminate that wouldn\\'t endanger national security BUSH: I don\\'t think it\\'s a question of eliminating  I can tell him some I\\'m against  A 6F  for example  DIVAD  And I can go on and on  Minuteman III  penetration systems  I mean  there\\'s plenty of them that I oppose  but what I am not going to do  when we are negotiating with the Soviet Union  sitting down talking to Mr  Gorbachev about how we achieve a 50 percent reduction in our strategic weapons  I\\'m not going to give away a couple of aces I that very tough card game  I\\'m simply not going to do that And under me  when I lead this country  the secretary of defense is going to have to make the choices  between how we keep  how we protect the survivability of our nuclear deployment on the Midgetman missile  or on the Minuteman  whatever it is  w e\\'re going to have to the MX  w e\\'re going to have to do that  It\\'s Christmas (Laughter)BUSH: w ouldn\\'t it be nice to be perfect DUKAKIS: I hope it isn\\'t Christmas when you make that decision BUSH: wouldn\\'t it be nice to be the ice man so you never make a mistake  These are the my answer is do not make these unilateral cuts  and everybody now realizes that peace through strength works  and so this is where I have a big difference Of course we\\'re going to have to make some determination on this  and we\\'re going to have to make it on the convention forces  But now we\\'ve got a very good concept called competitive strategies  w e will do what we do best  It\\'s a strategy that we\\'ve been working on for a couple of years  It is going to take us to much better advantage in conventional forces But look  let me sum it up  I want to be the president that gets conventional forces balance  I want to be the one to banish chemical and biological weapons from the face of the earth  But you have to have a little bit of experience to know where to start  And I think I\\'ve had that LEHRER: Governor DUKAKIS: w ell  first let me say with respect to the freeze  that back in the spring of 1982 Mr  Bush was a lot more sympathetic to the freeze than he seems to be today  As a matter of fact  he said it was not and should not be subject to partisan demagoguery because it was too important for the United States or for the world  I didn\\'t hear  John  exactly where he was going to cut and what he was going to do But I know this  we have serious financial problems in this country  w e\\'ve piled up over a trillion dollars in debt and the next president of the United States is going to have to make some choices Mr  Bush wants to spend billions on Star w ars  He apparently wants to spend billions on the MX on railroad cars  a weapons system we don\\'t need and can\\'t afford  I thought the administration was opposed to the Midgetman  I thought the administration was at the negotiating table in Geneva suggesting that we ban mobile missile systems entirely  But those are the choices the next president of the United States is going to have to make I\\'m for the Stealth  I\\'m for the D 5  I\\'m for going ahead with the advance Cruise missile  But I don\\'t think we need these other systems  I don\\'t think we need them to remain strong  w e\\'ve got to move ahead with the strategic arms negotiation process  with the comprehensive test ban treaty and with negotiations leading to conventional force reduction in Europe with deeper cuts on the Soviet side and Senator Bentsen and I will pursue that policy LEHRER: Anne Groer  a question for the Vice President GROER: w ell  Mr  Vice President  you said you\\'ve met with Secretary General Gorbachev  you\\'ve met with Mr  Shevardnadze  but for the last forty years Americans have been taught to regard the Soviet Union as the enemy  Yet  President Reagan has signed two arms control treaties and he\\'s promised to share Star w ars technology with the very country he once called the evil empire  So  perhaps you can tell us this evening  should we be doing a lot to help the economics and the social development of a country that we have so long regarded as an adversary BUSH: w hat I think we ought to do is take a look at perestroika and glasnost  welcome them  but keep our eyes open  Be cautious  Because the Soviet change is not fully established yet  Yes  I think it\\'s fine to do business with them  And  so  I\\'m encouraged with what I see when I talk to Mr     what I hear when I talk to Mr  Gorbachev and Mr  Shevardnadze  but can they pull it off And when they have a   they a   deals that are good for us  as China started to do  the changes in China since Barbara and I lived there is absolutely amazing  in terms of incentive  in partnership and things of this nature  And now the Soviet Union seems to be walking down that same path  w e should encourage that  w e ought to say this is good But where I differ with my opponent is I am not going to make unilateral cuts in our strategic defend systems or support some freeze when they have superiority  I\\'m not going to do that  because I think the jury is still out on the Soviet experiment And the interesting place one of the things that fascinates me about this perestroika and glasnost is wheats going to happen in Eastern Europe  You see the turmoil in Poland today  And I think we have enormous opportunity for trade  I don\\'t want to go back to the Carter grain embargo on the Soviets  w e are once again reliable suppliers and I would never use food as a political tool like our predecessors did  But this is an exciting time  But all I\\'m suggesting is let\\'s not be naÃ¯ve in dealing with the Soviets and make a lot of unilateral cuts hoping against hope that they will match our bid Look at the INF treaty  And if we haven\\'t learned from the negotiating history on that  we\\'ll never learn  The freeze people were wrong  The Reagan Bush administration was right LEHRER: Governor Dukakis DUKAKIS: It was a very different George Bush who was talking much more sympathetically about the freeze in the spring of 1982 than he is today  And you were right then  George  when you said it was no time for partisan demagoguery  Nobody is suggesting that we unilaterally disarm or somehow reduce our strength  of course not  w hat we\\'re talking about is a combination of a strong and effective and credible nuclear deterrent  Strong  well equipped  well trained  well maintained conventional forces  And at the same time a willingness to move forward steadily  thoughtfully cautiously w e have serious differences with the Soviet Union  w e have very fundamental differences about human rights  democracy and our basic system  our basic view of human beings and of what life is all about  But there are opportunities there now  Senator Bentsen and I have a plan for the 1990Ï€s and beyond  Mr  Bush and Mr  Quayle do not And we want to pursue that plan in a way which will bring down the level of nuclear armament  will build a more stable and more peaceful world while making choices here at home  Let\\'s not forget that our national security and our economic security go hand in hand  w e cannot be strong militarily when we\\'re teeter tottering on top of a mountain of debt which has been created in the past eight years  That\\'s why we need a Democratic administration in w ashington in 1989 (Applause)LEHRER: Anne Groer  a question for the Governor GROER: Yes  Governor Dukakis  speaking of seeming changes of position  you have gone from calling the Strategic Defense Initiative  or Star w ars  a fantasy and a fraud  to saying recently that you would continue SDI research and might even deploy the system if Congress supported such a move  w hy the change of heart DUKAKIS: No  there\\'s been no change of heart  I said from the beginning that we ought to continue research into the strategic system at about the level that was added in 1983  that\\'s about a billion dollars a year  But I don\\'t know of any reputable scientist who believed that this system  at least as originally conceived could possibly work  this notion of some kind of astrodome over ourselves that could protect us from enemy attack  It makes real sense  And as a matter of fact  the system that the administration is now talking about is very different from the one that was originally proposed in 1983 So  I\\'m for continued research  but I also want strong conventional forces  Now  the other day  Mr  Bush said  â‰¥w ell  if we continue with Star w ar Star w ars we have to cut some place â‰¤ He hasn\\'t told us where  w e know where they\\'re cutting  w e know where you\\'re cutting right now  You\\'re cutting into the fiber and muscle of our conventional forces  You\\'re cutting back on maintenance and equipment An Air Force General not too long ago in Europe who said that pretty soon we\\'d have airplanes without engines  tank commanders who can\\'t drive their tanks more than three quarters of a mile  because they don\\'t have enough fuel  Coast Guard cutters tied up at the dock this summer  not patrolling  They\\'re supposed to be our first line of defense against drugs and the war against drugs  because they don\\'t have enough fuel You have to make choices  w e\\'re not making those choices  And to spend billions and billions of dollars as Mr  Bush apparently wants to  although  he  himself has been all over the lot on this issue lately on Star w ars in my judgment makes no sense at all  w e need a strong  credible  effective nuclear deterrent  w e have 13 000 strategic nuclear warheads right now on land  on sea and in the air  enough to blow up the Soviet Union forty times over  They have about 12 000  So  we\\'ve got to move forward with those negotiations  get the level of strategic weapons down But to continue to commit billions to this system makes no sense at all and I think Mr  Bush has been reconsidering his position over the course of the past few weeks  That\\'s at least that\\'s what I read  Maybe he\\'ll tell us where he stand on it tonight LEHRER: Mr  Vice President BUSH: I\\'m not reconsidering my position  Two questions: How do you deter nuclear attack without modernizing our nuclear forces when the Soviets are modernizing and how come you spend willing to spend a dime on something that you consider a fantasy and a fraud  Those are two hypo rhetorical questions He is the man on conventional forces that wants to eliminate two carrier battle groups  The armed forces  the conventional forces of the United States have never been more ready  Every single one of the Joint Chiefs will testify to the fact that readiness is in an historic high  And secondly  in terms of the cutting of the Coast Guard  the Democratic controlled Congress  so please help us with that  who cut $70 million from the Coast Guard out of the interdiction effort on narcotics (Applause)BUSH: He\\'s got to get this thing more clear  w hy do you spend a billion dollars on something you think is a fantasy and a fraud  I will fully research it  go forward as fast as we can  w e\\'ve set up the levels of funding and when it is deployable  I will deploy it  That is my position on SDI and it\\'s never wavered a bit LEHRER: Peter Jennings  a question for Governor Dukakis JENNINGS: w ell  Governor  and Vice President Bush  you\\'ve both talked tonight about hard choices  Let me try to give you one  Somewhere in the Middle East tonight  nine Americans are being held hostage  If you are commander in chief and Americans are held hostage  what will be more important to you  their individual fate  or the commitment that the United States Government must never negotiate with terrorists  And if any Americans are held hostage and you become president  to what lengths would you go to rescue them DUKAKIS: Peter  it\\'s one of the most agonizing decisions a president has to make  These are American citizens  we care deeply about them  Their families care deeply about them  want them back and understandably so and we want to do everything we can to bring them back But if there\\'s one thing we also understand it is that you cannot make concessions to terrorists  ever  ever  Because if you do  it\\'s an open invitation to other terrorists to take hostages and to blackmail us  And that\\'s the tragedy of the Iran/Contra scandal As a matter of fact  Mr  Bush was the Chairman of a task force on international terrorism which issued a report shortly before that decision was made and said  and rightly so  that we never ever can make concessions to terrorists and hostage takers  And  yet  after sitting through meeting after meeting  he endorsed that decision  endorsed the sale of arms to the Ayatollah in exchange for hostages  one of the most tragic  one of the most mistaken foreign policy decisions we\\'ve ever made in this country and I dare say encouraged others to take hostages as we now know So  there can be no concessions under any circumstances  because if we do it\\'s an open invitation to others to do the same  w e\\'ve got to be tough on international terrorism  w e\\'ve got to treat it as international crime  w e\\'ve got to attack at all points  we\\'ve go to use undercover operations  w e have to be prepared to use military force against terrorist base camps  we have to work closely with our allies to make sure that they\\'re working with us and we with them and we can give no quarter when it comes to breaking the back of international terrorism Yes  we should make every effort to try to help those hostages come home  but it can never be because we make concessions  That was a tragic mistake that we made  a mistake that Mr  Bush made and others made and it should never ever be made again LEHRER: Mr  Vice President BUSH: I wrote the anti terrorist report for this government  It is the best anti terrorist report written  Yes  we shouldn\\'t trade arms for hostages  But we have made vast improvements in our anti terrorism  Now  it\\'s fine to say that sometimes you have to hit base camps  but when the president saw this state sponsored fingerprints of Muammar Khadaffi on the loss of American life  he hit Libya  And my opponent was unwilling to support that action DUKAKIS: That\\'s not true  That\\'s not true BUSH: And since that action  terrorist action against the United States citizens have gone down DUKAKIS: That\\'s not true BUSH: And I have long ago said I supported the president on this other matter  And I\\'ve said mistakes were made  Clearly nobody\\'s going to think the president started out thinking he was going to trade arms for hostages  That is a very serious charge against the president  The matter has been thoroughly looked into  But the point is sometimes the action (Laughter)BUSH:   has to be taken by the Federal Government and when we took action  it had a favorable response LEHRER: A question for the Vice President  Peter JENNINGS: It seems perhaps a good subject  Mr  Vice President  on which to make the point that you\\'ve campaigned vigorously as part of a leadership team  But so far you won\\'t tell the American people in considerable measure what advice you gave the president  including the sale of arms to Iran and what should have been done about the hostages  To the best of my knowledge there\\'s no Constitutional requirement which prevents you from doing so  Jimmy Carter urged his Vice President  w alter Mondale  to tell the American people  w ould you now ask President Reagan for permission to tell the American people what advice you did give him  And if you don\\'t  how do we judge your judgment in the Oval Office in the last eight years BUSH: You\\'re judged by the whole record  You\\'re judged by the entire record  Are we closer to peace  Are we doing better in anti terrorism  Should we have listened to my opponent who wanted to send the UN into the Persian Gulf or in spite of the mistakes of the past  are we doing better there  How is our credibility with the GCC countries on the w estern side of the Gulf  Is Iran talking to Iraq about peace  You judge on the record  Are the Soviets coming out of Afghanistan  How does it look in a program he called or some one of these marvelous Boston adjective up there and about Angola now  we have a chance several Bostonians don\\'t like it  but the rest of the country will understand (Applause)BUSH: Now we have a chance  Now we have a chance  And  so  I think that I\\'d leave it right there and say that you judge on the whole record  And let me say this all he can talk about he goes around ranting about Noriega  Now  I\\'ve told you what the intelligence briefing he received said about that  He can talk about Iran/Contra and also I\\'ll make a deal with you  I will take the blame for those two incidents if you give me half the credit for all the good things that have happened in world peace since Ronald Reagan and I took over from the Carter administration (Applause)BUSH: I still have a couple of minutes left  And there is a difference principle  LEHRER: Sorry  Mr  Vice President BUSH: It\\'s only on yellow here  w ait a minute (Laughter)LEHRER: I\\'m wrong  Go ahead  My apologies BUSH: Jim  LEHRER: You said nobody\\'s perfect BUSH: I said I wasn\\'t perfect  w here was I DUKAKIS: 25th of December  Mr  Vice President (Laughter)BUSH: I finished DUKAKIS: He can have another ten seconds if he wants  Jim LEHRER: Governor  you have a minute to respond DUKAKIS: w ell  the matter of judgment is very important  And I think it\\'s important to understand what happened here A report on international terrorism chaired by the Vice President was released and made some very specific recommendations about how to deal with terrorism  They were ignored  The Vice President ignored them  He says mistakes were made  Very serious mistakes in judgment were made  He says  â‰¥w ell  let\\'s concede that the administration has been doing business with Noriega  Has made him a part of our foreign policy and has been funneling aid to Contras through convicted drug dealers â‰¤I think those are very very serious questions of judgment  which those of you who are watching us here tonight have a right to judge and review  w e\\'re not going to make those kinds of mistakes  You cannot make concessions to terrorists  If you do  you invite the taking of more hostages  That\\'s a basic principle  It was ignored in that case and it was a very very serious mistake in judgment LEHRER: A question from John Mashek  It goes to the Vice President MASHEK: Mr  Vice President  Democrats and even some Republicans are still expressing reservations about the qualifications and credentials of Senator Dan Quayle of Indiana  your chosen running mate  to be a heartbeat away from the presidency  w hat do you see in him that others do not (Laughter)BUSH: I see a young man that was elected to the Senate twice  to the House of Representatives twice  I see a man who is young and I am putting my confidence in a whole generation of people that are in their 30Ï€s and 40Ï€s  I see a man that took the leadership in the Job Training Partnership Act and that retrains people in this highly competitive changing society we\\'re in  so if a person loses his hob he is retrained for a benefit for a work that will be productive and he won\\'t have to go on one of these many programs that the liberal talking about I see a young man who is a knowledgeable in defense and there are three people on our ticket that are knowledgeable in the whole in the race knowledgeable in defense and Dan Quayle is one of them and I am one of them  And I believe that he will be outstanding  And he took a tremendous pounding and everybody now knows that he took a very unfair pounding  And I\\'d like each person to say did I jump to conclusions running down rumors that were so outrageous and so brutal  And he\\'s kept his head up  And he will do very very well  And he has my full confidence and he\\'ll have the confidence of people that are in their 30Ï€s and 40Ï€s and more  So  judge the man on his record not on the lot of rumors and innuendo and trying to fool around with his name My opponent says J  Danforth Quayle  Do you know who J  Danforth was  he was a man who gave his life in w orld w ar II  so ridiculing a person\\'s name is a little beneath this process  And he\\'ll do very well when we get into the debates (Applause)DUKAKIS: w ell  when it comes to ridicule  George  you win a gold medal  I think we can agree on that in the course of this campaign (Applause)BUSH: Just the facts DUKAKIS: But did I did I sense a desire that maybe Lloyd Bentsen ought to be your running mate when you said there are three people on your ticket BUSH: No  I think the debate ought to be between you and Lloyd DUKAKIS: I think the American people have a right to judge us on this question  on how we picked a running mate  a person who is a heartbeat away from the presidency  I picked Lloyd Bentsen  distinguished  strong  mature  a leader in the Senate  somebody whose qualifications nobody has questioned  Mr  Bush picked Dan Quayle I doubt very much that Dan Quayle was the best qualified person for that job  And as a matter of fact  I think for most people the notion of President Quayle is a very very troubling thought LEHRER: John will ask a question of the Governor  It will be the last question and then the Vice President will have a rebuttal MASHEK: w ell  Governor  you did select Lloyd Bentsen of Texas DUKAKIS: I did indeed MASHEK: And you have a lot of disagreement with him on fundamental issues  including the Reagan tax cuts  aid to the rebels in Nicaragua  the death penalty  gun control  w ho\\'s right (Laughter)DUKAKIS: w ell  John  I\\'m a man that\\'s been a chief executive for ten years  I\\'ve picked a lot of people  I\\'ve picked cabinets  I\\'ve named judges  I know that the people you pick make an enormous difference in your ability to govern and I set high standards  I try to meet them and I insist that people who work for me meet them  if they don\\'t  they don\\'t stick around very long But I didn\\'t pick Lloyd Bentsen because he was a clone of Mike Dukakis  I picked him because he was somebody who would be a strong Vice President  somebody who would be an active Vice President  Somebody who would come to me if somebody came up with a crazy idea that we ought to trade arms to the Ayatollah for hostages and say  â‰¥Mr  President  that\\'s wrong  w e shouldn\\'t do that â‰¤ That\\'s the kind of Vice President I want He  himself  has said  and rightly so  that he\\'ll be a strong Vice President  w hen the Vice President makes a decision  that will be his decision  And I\\'m very very proud of that choice  And I didn\\'t pick him because he agreed with me on everything You know  Sam Rayburn once said that if two people agree on everything then only one person is doing the thinking  The fact is I\\'ve picked somebody who not only will be a great Vice President  but if  God forbid  something happens to the president  could step into that office and do so with distinction and with strength and with leadership  I doubt very much  I doubt very much that Mr  Bush\\'s selection for the Vice Presidency of the United States meets that test (Applause)LEHRER: Mr  Vice President BUSH: w ell  I we obviously have a difference  I believe it does meet the test  w e\\'ll have an opportunity to see the two of them in action in a friendly forum  wonderful friendly fashion like this (Laughter)BUSH: I had hoped this had been a little friendlier evening  I wanted to hitchhike a ride home in his tank with him  But now we\\'ve got the lines too carefully drawn here  But you talk about judgment  I mean  what kind of judgment I mean  jumping all over the president on his decision on one area of farm policy  w hat kind of judgment sense has your chief education adviser now in jail in Massachusetts  I mean  there\\'s I don\\'t think this is a fair argument  But nevertheless  I support my nominee for Vice President and he\\'ll do an outstanding job LEHRER: Gentlemen  I was given some bad word a moment ago  There is time for one more question  Getting it in my ear and Ann Groer will ask it  Ann  To the Governor GROER: Governor Dukakis  as many U S  farmers face or undergo foreclosure  the United States is considering the possibility of forgiving a certain percentage of debt owed by Latin American and Third w orld countries  do you favor giving these countries a break in their loans and  if so  how do you explain that to the American farmers who are losing their land and livelihood DUKAKIS: w ell  I think we have to go to work on the problem of Third w orld debt and we\\'ve got to assist those Third w orld countries in dealing with this massive debt which they currently which they have incurred and which is burdening them and which if we don\\'t do something about it and assist them along with other nations around the world  we\\'ll destroy their economies  destroy their future  And at the same time will destroy markets that are important to our farmers But I also believe we need an agricultural policy which doesn\\'t cost us 15 to 20 to 25 billion dollars a year that it\\'s been costing us over the course of the past three or four years under this administration  I think it\\'s going to require good  solid credit policies  And thanks to the Congress we now have an agricultural credit bill which is helping and improving the situation with at least some of our farmers I think it\\'s going to require a combination of supply management and reasonable price supports to make sure that our farmers get a decent price and I think it also is going to require an administration that understand that there are tremendous opportunities out there for the development of new uses for agricultural products  new uses which can help us to clean up our environment at the same time  Bio degradable plastics plastic gasohol  which the Vice President has been involved in  road de icers made from corn products  I mean  there are enormous opportunities out there to expand markets and to build a strong future for our farmers But I don\\'t think there\\'s anything mutually exclusive or contradictory about building a strong farm economy in this country and assisting our family farms and providing a good strong future for rural communities and for rural America and at the same time working on Third w orld debt As a matter of fact  Mexico  itself  is one of our biggest agricultural customers  so in the sense that we can work to help Mexico rebuild and expand and deal with these very serious economic problems we help our farmers at the same time LEHRER: Mr  Vice President BUSH: I oppose supply management and production controls  I support the farm bill  the 1985 farm bill and spending is moving in the right direction  I want to expand our markets abroad and that\\'s why I\\'ve called for that first economic summit to be on agriculture I will not go back to the way the Democrats did it and used food as a political weapon and throw a grain embargo on the farmers in this country  I want to see rural redevelopment and I have been out front in favor of alternate sources of energy and one of them is gasohol and comes from using your corn and I think we can do better in terms of biodegradable for a lot of product  so I\\'m optimistic about the agricultural economy In terms of the Third w orld  I support the Baker plan  I want to see market economies spring up all around the world and to the degree they do  we are succeeding  And I don\\'t want to see the banks let off the hook  I would oppose that  but I think were on the right track in agriculture and I am very very encouraged  But let\\'s not go back to that what they call supply management and production control  that\\'ll simply price us out of the international market  Let\\'s try to expand our markets abroad LEHRER: All right  That really is the end  Now  let\\'s go to closing statements  They will be two minutes each in duration by agreement  Vice President Bush goes first  Governor Dukakis second  Mr  Vice President BUSH: I talked in New Orleans about a gentler and kinder nation and I have made specific proposals on education and the environment and on ethics and energy and how we do better in battling crime in our country  But there are two main focal points of this election  Opportunity and peace I want to keep this expansion going  Yes  we want change but we are the change  I am the change  I don\\'t want to go back to malaise and misery index  And  so  opportunity  Keep America at work  The best poverty program is a job with dignity in the private sector  And in terms of peace  we are on the right track  w e\\'ve achieved an arms control agreement that our critics thought was never possible and I want to build on it  I want to see us finalize that START agreement and I want it to be the one to finally lead the world to banishing chemical and biological weapons I want to see asymmetrical reductions in conventional forces  And then it gets down to a question of values  w e\\'ve had a chance to spell out our differences on the Pledge of Allegiance here tonight and on tough sentencing of drug king pins and this kind of thing  And I do favor the death penalty  And we\\'ve got a wide array of differences on those  But in the final analysis in the final analysis  the person goes into that voting booth  they\\'re going to say  â‰¥w ho has the values I believe in  w ho has the experience that we trust  w ho has the integrity and stability to get the job done â‰¤ My fellow Americans  I am that man and I ask for your support  Thank you very much (Applause)DUKAKIS: This has been an extraordinary 18 months for Kitty and me and for our family  w e\\'ve had an opportunity to campaign all over this country and to meet with so many of you in communities and states and regions to get to know you  I\\'m more optimistic today than I was when I began about this nation providing we have the kind of leadership in w ashington that can work with you  that can build partnerships  that can build jobs in every part of this country  not certain parts of this country You know  my friends  my parents came to this country as immigrants like millions and millions of Americans before them and since  seeking opportunities  seeking the American dream  They made sure their sons understood that this was the greatest country in the world  that those of us especially who were the sons and daughters of immigrants had a special responsibility to give something to the country that had opened up its arms to our parents and given so much to them I believe in the American dream  I\\'m a product of it and I want to help that dream come true for every single citizen in this land  with a good job and good wages  with good schools in every part of this country and every community in this country  w ith decent and affordable housing that our people can buy and own and live in  so that we end the shame of hopelessness in America  w ith decent and affordable healthcare for all working families Yes  it\\'s a tough problem as Mr  Bush says  but itÏ€s not an insolvable problem  It\\'s one that we will solve and must solve  with a clean and wholesome environment and with a strong America that\\'s strong militarily and economically as we must be  an America that provides strong international leadership because we\\'re true to our values w e have an opportunity working together to build that future  to build a better America  to build a best America  because the best America doesn\\'t hide  w e compete  The best America  w e invest  The best America doesn\\'t leave some of its citizens behind  w e live we bring everybody along  And the best America is not behind us  The best America is yet to come  Thank you very much (Applause)',\n",
       " 'October 7  1984 Debate TranscriptOctober 7  1984The First Reagan Mondale Presidential DebateMS  RIDINGS: Good evening from the Kentucky Center for the Arts in Louisville  Kentucky  I\\'m Dorothy Ridings  president of the League of w omen Voters  the sponsor of tonight\\'s first Presidential debate between Republican Ronald Reagan and Democrat w alter Mondale Tonight\\'s debate marks the third consecutive Presidential election in which the League is presenting the candidates for the Nation\\'s highest office in face to face debate Our panelists are James w ieghart  national political correspondent for Scripps Howard News Service; Diane Sawyer  correspondent for the CBS program ``60 Minutes;\\'\\' and Fred Barnes  national political correspondent for the Baltimore Sun  Barbara w alters of ABC News  who is appearing in her fourth Presidential debate  is our moderator Barbara MS  w ALTERS: Thank you  Dorothy A few words as we begin tonight\\'s debate about the format  The position of the candidates    that is  who answers questions first and who gives the last statement    was determined by a toss of a coin between the two candidates  Mr  Mondale won  and that means that he chose to give the final closing statement  It means  too  that the President will answer the first question first  I hope that\\'s clear  If it isn\\'t  it will become clear as the debate goes on Further  the candidates will be addressed as they each wanted and will  therefore  be called \"Mr  President\\'\\' and \"Mr  Mondale \\'\\'Since there will also be a second debate between the two Presidential candidates  tonight will focus primarily on the economy and other domestic issues  The debate  itself  is built around questions from the panel  In each of its segments  a reporter will ask the candidates the same general question  Then    and this is important    each candidate will have the chance to rebut what the other has said  And the final segment of the debate will be the closing segment  and the candidates will each have 4 minutes for their closing statements  And as I have said  Mr  Mondale will be the last person on the program to speak And now I would like to add a personal note if I may  As Dorothy Ridings pointed out  I have been involved now in four Presidential debates  either as a moderator or as a panelist  In the past  there was no problem in selecting panelists  Tonight  however  there were to have been four panelists participating in this debate The candidates were given a list of almost 100 qualified journalists from all the media and could agree on only these three fine journalists  As moderator  and on behalf of my fellow journalists  I very much regret  as does the League of w omen Voters  that this situation has occurred And now let us begin the debate with the first question from James w ieghart Mr  w ieghart The Nation\\'s EconomyMR  w IEGHART: Mr  President  in 1980 you promised the American people    in your campaign    a balanced budget by 1983  w e\\'ve now had more and bigger deficits in the 4 years you\\'ve been in office  Mr  President  do you have a secret plan to balance the budget sometime in a second term  and if so  would you lay out that plan for us tonight The President  I have a plan    not a secret plan  As a matter of fact  it is the economic recovery program that we presented when I took office in 1981 It is true that earlier  working with some very prominent economists  I had come up  during the campaign  with an economic program that I thought could rectify the great problems confronting us    the double digit inflation  the high tax rates that I think were hurting the economy  the stagflation that we were undergoing  Before even the election day  something that none of those economists had even predicted had happened  that the economy was so worsened that I was openly saying that what we had thought on the basis of our plan could have brought a balanced budget    no  that was no longer possible So  the plan that we have had and that we are following is a plan that is based on growth in the economy  recovery without inflation  and reducing the share that the Government is taking from the gross national product  which has become a drag on the economy Already  we have a recovery that has been going on for about 21 months to the point that we can now call it an expansion  Under that  this year  we have seen a $21 billion reduction in the deficit from last year  based mainly on the increased revenues the Government is getting without raising tax rates Our tax cut  we think  was very instrumental in bringing about this economic recovery  w e have reduced inflation to about a third of what it was  The interest rates have come down about 9 or 10 points and  we think  must come down further  In the last 21 months  more than 6 million people have gotten jobs    there have been created new jobs for those people to where there are now 105 million civilians working  where there were only 99 million before; 107  if you count the military So  we believe that as we continue to reduce the level of government spending    the increase  rate of increase in government spending  which has come down from 17 to 6 percent  and  at the same time  as the growth in the economy increases the revenues the Government gets  without raising taxes  those two lines will meet  And when they meet  that is a balanced budget MR  w IEGHART: Mr  President  the Congressional Budget Office has some bad news  The lines aren\\'t about to meet  according to their projections  They project that the budget deficit will continue to climb  In the year 1989 they project a budget deficit of $273 billion In view of that  and in view of the economic recovery we are now enjoying  would it make sense to propose a tax increase or take some other fiscal measures to reduce that deficit now  when times are relatively good The President  The deficit is the result of excessive government spending  I do not  very frankly  take seriously the Congressional Budget Office projections  because they have been wrong on virtually all of them  including the fact that our recovery wasn\\'t going to take place to begin with  But it has taken place But  as I said  we have the rate of increase in government spending down to 6 percent  If the rate of increase in government spending can be held at 5 percent    we\\'re not far from there    by 1989 that would have reduced the budget deficits down to a $30 or $40 billion level  At the same time  if we can have a 4 percent recovery continue through that same period of time  that will mean    without an increase in tax rates    that will mean $400 billion more in government revenues  And so  I think that the lines can meet Actually  in constant dollars  in the domestic side of the budget  there has been no spending increase in the 4 years that we have been here MR  w IEGHART: Mr  Mondale  the Carter Mondale administration didn\\'t come close to balancing the budget in its 4 years in office either  despite the fact that President Carter did promise a balanced budget during his term You have proposed a plan combining tax increases and budgetary cuts and other changes in the administration of the Government that would reduce the projected budget deficit by two thirds  to approximately $87 billion in 1989  That still is an enormous deficit that will be running for these 4 years  w hat other steps do you think should be taken to reduce this deficit and position the country for economic growth MR  MONDALE: One of the key tests of leadership is whether one sees clearly the nature of the problems confronted by our nation  And perhaps the dominant domestic issue of our times is what do we do about these enormous deficits I respect the President; I respect the Presidency  and I think he knows that  But the fact of it is  every estimate by this administration about the size of the deficit has been off by billions and billions of dollars  As a matter of fact  over 4 years  they\\'ve missed the mark by nearly $600 billion  w e were told we would have a balanced budget in 1983  It was $200 billion deficit instead  And now we have a major question facing the American people as to whether we\\'ll deal with this deficit and get it down for the sake of a healthy recovery Virtually every economic analysis that I\\'ve heard of  including the distinguished Congressional Budget Office  which is respected by  I think  almost everyone  says that even with historically high levels of economic growth  we will suffer a $263 billion deficit  In other words  it doesn\\'t converge as the President suggests  It gets larger even with growth w hat that means is that we will continue to have devastating problems with foreign trade  This is the worst trade year in American history by far  Our rural and farm friends will have continued devastation  Real interest rates    the real cost of interest    will remain very  very high  and many economists are predicting that we\\'re moving into a period of very slow growth because the economy is tapering off and may be a recession  I get it down to a level below 2 percent of gross national product with a policy that\\'s fair  I\\'ve stood up and told the American people that I think it\\'s a real problem  that it can destroy long term economic growth  and I\\'ve told you what I think should be done I think this is a test of leadership  and I think the American people know the difference MR  w IEGHART: Mr  Mondale  one other way to attack the deficit is further reductions in spending  The President has submitted a number of proposals to Congress to do just that  and in many instances the House  controlled by the Democrats  has opposed them  Isn\\'t it one aspect of leadership for prominent Democrats such as yourself to encourage responsible reductions in spending  and thereby reduce the deficit MR  MONDALE: Absolutely  and I proposed over a hundred billion dollars in cuts in Federal spending over 4 years  but I am not going to cut it out of Social Security and Medicare and student assistance and things    [applause]    that people need  These people depend upon all of us for the little security that they have  and I\\'m not going to do it that way The rate of defense spending increase can be slowed  Certainly we can find a coffeepot that costs something less than $7 000  And there are other ways of squeezing this budget without constantly picking on our senior citizens and the most vulnerable in American life  And that\\'s why the Congress  including the Republicans  have not gone along with the President\\'s recommendations MS  w ALTERS: I would like to ask the audience please to refrain from applauding either side; it just takes away from the time for your candidates And now it is time for the rebuttal  Mr  President  1 minute for rebuttal THE PRESIDENT: Yes  I don\\'t believe that Mr  Mondale has a plan for balancing the budget; he has a plan for raising taxes  And  as a matter of fact  the biggest single tax increase in our nation\\'s history took place 1977  And for the 5 years previous to our taking office  taxes doubled in the United States  and the budgets increased $318 billion  So  there is no ratio between taxing and balancing a budget  w hether you borrow the money or whether you simply tax it away from the people  you\\'re taking the same amount of money out of the private sector  unless and until you bring down government\\'s share of what it is taking w ith regard to Social Security  I hope there\\'ll be more time than just this minute to mention that  but I will say this: A President should never say \"never \\'\\' But I\\'m going to violate that rule and say \"never \\'\\' I will never stand for a reduction of the Social Security benefits to the people that are now getting them MS  w ALTERS: Mr  Mondale MR  MONDALE: w ell  that\\'s exactly the commitment that was made to the American people in 1980: He would never reduce benefits  And of course  what happened right after the election is they proposed to cut Social Security benefits by 25 percent    reducing the adjustment for inflation  cutting out minimum benefits for the poorest on Social Security  removing educational benefits for dependents whose widows were trying    with widows trying to get them through college  Everybody remembers that; people know what happened There\\'s a difference  I have fought for Social Security and Medicare and for things to help people who are vulnerable all my life  and I will do it as President of the United States MS  w ALTERS: Thank you very much  w e\\'ll now begin with segment number two with my colleague  Diane Sawyer Ms  Sawyer Leadership QualitiesMS  SAw YER: Mr  President  Mr  Mondale  the public opinion polls do suggest that the American people are most concerned about the personal leadership characteristics of the two candidates  and each of you has questioned the other\\'s leadership ability  Mr  President  you have said that Mr  Mondale\\'s leadership would take the country down the path of defeatism and despair  and Vice President Bush has called him whining and hoping for bad news  And  Mr  Mondale  you have said that President Reagan offers showmanship  not leadership  that he has not mastered what he must know to command his government I\\'d like to ask each of you to substantiate your claims    Mr  Mondale first  Give us specifics to support your claim that President Reagan is a showman  not a leader; has not mastered what he must know to be President after 4 years  and then  second  tell us what personal leadership characteristics you have that he does not MR  MONDALE: w ell  first of all  I think the first answer this evening suggests exactly what I\\'m saying  There is no question that we face this massive deficit  and almost everybody agrees unless we get it down  the chances for long term  healthy growth are nil  And it\\'s also unfair to dump these tremendous bills on our children The President says it will disappear overnight because of some reason  No one else believes that\\'s the case  I do  and I\\'m standing up to the issue with an answer that\\'s fair  I think that\\'s what leadership is all about  There\\'s a difference between being a quarterback and a cheerleader  and when there\\'s a real problem  a President must confront it w hat I was referring to  of course  in the comment that you referred to was the situation in Lebanon  Now  for three occasions  one after another  our Embassies were assaulted in the same way by a truck with demolitions  The first time    and I did not criticize the President  because these things can happen    once  and sometimes twice    the second time the barracks in Lebanon were assaulted  as we all remember  There was two or three commission reports  recommendations by the CIA  the State Department  and the others  and the third time there was even a warning from the terrorists themselves Now  I believe that a President must command that w hite House and those who work for him  It\\'s the toughest job on Earth  and you must master the facts and insist that things that must be done are done  I believe that the way in which I will approach the Presidency is what\\'s needed  because all my life that has been the way in which I have sought to lead  And that\\'s why in this campaign I\\'m telling you exactly what I want to do  I am answering your questions  I am trying to provide leadership now  before the election  so that the American people can participate in that decision MS  SAw YER: You have said  Mr  Mondale  that the polls have given you lower ratings on leadership than President Reagan because your message has failed to get through  Given that you have been in public office for so many years  what accounts for the failure of your message to get through MR  MONDALE: w ell  I think we\\'re getting better all the time  And I think tonight  as we contrast for the first time our differing approach to government  to values  to the leadership in this country  I think as this debate goes forward  the American people will have for the first time a chance to weigh the two of us against each other  And I think  as a part of that process  what I am trying to say will come across  and that is that we must lead  we must command  we must direct  and a President must see it like it is  He must stand for the values of decency that the American people stand for  and he must use the power of the w hite House to try to control these nuclear weapons and lead this world toward a safer world MS  SAw YER: Mr  President  the issue is leadership in personal terms  First  do you think  as Vice President Bush said  that Mr  Mondale\\'s campaign is one of whining and hoping for bad news  And second  what leadership characteristics do you possess that Mr  Mondale does not THE PRESIDENT: w ell  whether he does or not  let me suggest my own idea about the leadership factor  since you\\'ve asked it  And  incidentally  I might say that with regard to the 25 percent cut in Social Security    before I get to the answer to your question    the only 25 percent cut that I know of was accompanying that huge 1977 tax increase  was a cut of 25 percent in the benefits for every American who was born after 1916 Now  leadership  First of all  I think you must have some principles you believe in  In mine  I happen to believe in the people and believe that the people are supposed to be dominant in our society    that they  not government  are to have control of their own affairs to the greatest extent possible  with an orderly society Now  having that  I think also that in leadership    well  I believe that you find people  positions such as I\\'m in who have the talent and ability to do the things that are needed in the various departments of government  I don\\'t believe that a leader should be spending his time in the Oval Office deciding who\\'s going to play tennis on the w hite House court  And you let those people go with the guidelines of overall policy  not looking over their shoulder and nitpicking the manner in which they go at the job  You are ultimately responsible  however  for that job But I also believe something else about that  I believe that    and when I became Governor of California  I started this  and I continue it in this office    that any issue that comes before me  I have instructed Cabinet members and staff they are not to bring up any of the political ramifications that might surround the issue  I don\\'t want to hear them  I want to hear only arguments as to whether it is good or bad for the people    is it morally right  And on that basis and that basis alone  we make a decision on every issue Now  with regard to my feeling about why I thought that his record bespoke his possible taking us back to the same things that we knew under the previous administration  his record is that he spoke in praise of deficits several times  said they weren\\'t to be abhorred    that  as a matter of fact  he at one time said he wished the deficit could be doubled  because they stimulate the economy and helped reduce unemployment MS  SAw YER: As a followup  let me draw in another specific  if I could    a specific that the Democrats have claimed about your campaign    that it is essentially based on imagery  And one specific that they allege is that  for instance  recently you showed up at the opening ceremony of a Buffalo old age housing project  when in fact  your policy was to cut Federal housing subsidies for the elderly  Yet you were there to have your picture taken with them THE PRESIDENT: Our policy was not to cut subsidies  w e have believed in partnership  and that was an example of a partnership between  not only local government and the Federal Government but also between the private sector that built that particular structure  And this is what we\\'ve been trying to do  is involve the Federal Government in such partnerships w e are today subsidizing housing for more than 10 million people  and we\\'re going to continue along that line  w e have no thought of throwing people out into the snow  whether because of age or need  w e have preserved the safety net for the people with true need in this country  and it has been pure demagoguery that we have in some way shut off all the charitable programs or many of them for the people who have real need  The safety net is there  and we\\'re taking care of more people than has ever been taken care of before by any administration in this country MS  w ALTERS: Mr  Mondale  an opportunity for you to rebut MR  MONDALE: w ell  I guess I\\'m reminded a little bit of what w ill Rogers once said about Hoover  He said  \"It\\'s not what he doesn\\'t know that bothers me; it\\'s what he knows for sure that just ain\\'t so \\'\\' [Laughter] The fact of it is: The President\\'s budget sought to cut Social Security by 25 percent  It\\'s not an opinion; it\\'s a fact  And when the President was asked the other day  \"w hat do you want to cut in the budget \\'\\'  he said  \"Cut those things I asked for but didn\\'t get \\'\\' That\\'s Social Security and Medicare The second fact is that the housing unit for senior citizens that the President dedicated in Buffalo was only made possible through a Federal assistance program for senior citizens that the President\\'s budget sought to terminate  So  if he\\'d had his way  there wouldn\\'t have been any housing project there at all  This administration has taken a meat cleaver out  in terms of Federal assisted housing  and the record is there  w e have to see the facts before we can draw conclusions MS  w ALTERS: Mr  President THE PRESIDENT: w ell  let me just respond with regard to Social Security  w hen we took office  we discovered that the program that the Carter Mondale administration had said would solve the fiscal problems of Social Security for the next 50 years wouldn\\'t solve them for 5  Social Security was due to go bankrupt before 1983 Any proposals that I made at that time were at the request of the chairman  a Democrat  of one of the leading committees  who said we have to do something before the program goes broke and the checks bounce  And so  we made a proposal  And then in 1982  they used that proposal in a demagogic fashion for the 1982 campaign  And 3 days after the election in 1982  they came to us and said  Social Security  we know  is broke  Indeed  we had to borrow $17 billion to pay the checks  And then I asked for a bipartisan commission  which I\\'d asked for from the beginning  to sit down and work out a solution And so  the whole matter of what to do with Social Security has been resolved by bipartisan legislation  and it is on a sound basis now for as far as you can see into the next century MS  w ALTERS: Mr  President  we begin segment number three with Fred Barnes ReligionMR  BARNES: Mr  President  would you describe your religious beliefs  noting particularly whether you consider yourself a born again Christian  and explain how these beliefs affect your Presidential decisions THE PRESIDENT: w ell  I was raised to have a faith and a belief and have been a member of a church since I was a small boy  In our particular church  we did not use that term  \"born again \\'\\' so I don\\'t know whether I would fit that    that particular term  But I have    thanks to my mother  God rest her soul    the firmest possible belief and faith in God  And I don\\'t believe    I believe  I should say  as Lincoln once said  that I could not    I would be the most stupid man in the world if I thought I could confront the duties of the office I hold if I could not turn to someone who was stronger and greater than all others  And I do resort to prayer At the same time  however  I have not believed that prayer should be introduced into an election or be a part of a political campaign    or religion a part of that campaign  As a matter of fact  I think religion became a part of this campaign when Mr  Mondale\\'s running mate said I wasn\\'t a good Christian So  it does play a part in my life  I have no hesitancy in saying so  And  as I say  I don\\'t believe that I could carry on unless I had a belief in a higher authority and a belief that prayers are answered MR  BARNES: Given those beliefs  Mr  President  why don\\'t you attend services regularly  either by going to church or by inviting a minister to the w hite House  as President Nixon used to do  or someone to Camp David  as President Carter used to do THE PRESIDENT: The answer to your question is very simple about why I don\\'t go to church  I have gone to church regularly all my life  and I started to here in w ashington  And now  in the position I hold and in the world in which we live  where Embassies do get blown up in Beirut    we\\'re supposed to talk about that on the debate the 21st  I understand    but I pose a threat to several hundred people if I go to church I know the threats that are made against me  w e all know the possibility of terrorism  w e have seen the barricades that have had to be built around the w hite House  And  therefore  I don\\'t feel    and my minister knows this and supports me in this position    I don\\'t feel that I have a right to go to church  knowing that my being there could cause something of the kind that we have seen in other places  in Beirut  for example  And I miss going to church  but I think the Lord understands  [Applause]MS  w ALTERS: May I ask you  please    [applause]    may I ask the audience please to refrain from applause Fred  your second question MR  BARNES: Mr  Mondale  would you describe your religious beliefs and mention whether you consider yourself a born again Christian  and explain how those beliefs would affect your decisions as President MR  MONDALE: First of all  I accept President Reagan\\'s affirmation of faith  I\\'m sure that we all accept and admire his commitment to his faith  and we are strengthened  all of us  by that fact I am a son of a Methodist minister  My wife is the daughter of a Presbyterian minister  And I don\\'t know if I\\'ve been born again  but I know I was born into a Christian family  And I believe I have sung at more weddings and more funerals than anybody ever to seek the Presidency  w hether that helps or not  I don\\'t know I have a deep religious faith  Our family does  It is fundamental  It\\'s probably the reason that I\\'m in politics  I think our faith tells us  instructs us  about the moral life that we should lead  And I think we\\'re all together on that w hat bothers me is this growing tendency to try to use one\\'s own personal interpretation of faith politically  to question others\\' faith  and to try to use the instrumentalities of government to impose those views on others  All history tells us that that\\'s a mistake w hen the Republican platform says that from here on out  we\\'re going to have a religious test for judges before they\\'re selected for the Federal court  and then Jerry Falwell announces that that means they get at least two Justices of the Supreme Court  I think that\\'s an abuse of faith in our country This nation is the most religious nation on Earth    more people go to church and synagogues than any other nation on Earth    and it\\'s because we kept the politicians and the state out of the personal exercise of our faith  That\\'s why faith in the United States is pure and unpolluted by the intervention of politicians  And I think if we want to continue    as I do    to have a religious nation  lets keep that line and never cross it MS  w ALTERS: Thank you  Mr  Barnes  next question  w e have time for rebuttal now MR  BARNES: I think I have a followup MS  w ALTERS: Yes  I asked you if you did  I\\'m sorry      MR  BARNES: Yes  I do MS  w ALTERS:       I thought you waived it MR  BARNES: Yes  Mr  Mondale  you\\'ve complained  just now  about Jerry Falwell  and you\\'ve complained other times about other fundamentalists in politics  Correct me if I\\'m wrong  but I don\\'t recall your ever complaining about ministers who are involved in the civil rights movement or in the anti Vietnam war demonstrations or about black preachers who\\'ve been so involved in American politics  Is it only conservative ministers that you object to MR  MONDALE: No  w hat I object to    [applause]    what I object to    what I object to is someone seeking to use his faith to question the faith of another or to use that faith and seek to use the power of government to impose it on others A minister who is in civil rights or in the conservative movement  because he believes his faith instructs him to do that  I admire  The fact that the faith speaks to us and that we are moral people  hopefully  I accept and rejoice in  It\\'s when you try to use that to undermine the integrity of private political    or private religious faith and the use of the state is where    for the most personal decisions in American life    that\\'s where I draw the line MS  w ALTERS: Thank you  Now  Mr  President  rebuttal THE PRESIDENT: Yes  it\\'s very difficult to rebut  because I find myself in so much agreement with Mr  Mondale  I  too  want that wall that is in the Constitution of separation of church and state to remain there  The only attacks I have made are on people who apparently would break away at that wall from the government side  using the government  using the power of the courts and so forth to hinder that part of the Constitution that says the government shall not only not establish a religion  it shall not inhibit the practice of religion  And they have been using these things to have government  through court orders  inhibit the practice of religion  A child wants to say grace in a school cafeteria and a court rules that they can\\'t do it because it\\'s school property  These are they types of things that I think have been happening in a kind of a secular way that have been eroding that separation  and I am opposed to that w ith regard to a platform on the Supreme Court  I can only say one thing about that  I have appointed one member to the Supreme Court: Sandra Day O\\'Connor  I\\'ll stand on my record on that  And if I have the opportunity to appoint any more  I\\'ll do it in the same manner that I did in selecting her MS  w ALTERS: Mr  Mondale  your rebuttal  please MR  MONDALE: The platform to which the President refers  in fact  calls for a religious test in the selection of judges  And Jerry Falwell says that means we get two or three judges  And it would involve a religious test for the first time in American life Let\\'s take the example that the President cites  I believe in prayer  My family prays  w e\\'ve never had any difficulty finding time to pray  But do we want a constitutional amendment adopted of the kind proposed by the President that gets the local politicians into the business of selecting prayers that our children must either recite in school or be embarrassed and asked to excuse themselves  w ho would write the prayer  w hat would it say  How would it be resolved when those disputes occur It seems to me that a moment\\'s reflection tells you why the United States Senate turned that amendment down  because it will undermine the practice of honest faith in our country by politicizing it  w e don\\'t want that MS  w ALTERS: Thank you  Mr  Mondale  Our time is up for this round w e go into the second round of our questioning  begin again with Jim w ieghart Jim Political IssuesMR  w IEGHART: After that discussion  this may be like going from the sublime to the ridiculous  but here goes  I have a political question for you  Mr  Mondale  [Laughter]Polls indicate a massive change in the electorate  away from the coalition that has long made the Democratic Party a majority  Blue collar workers  young professionals  their children  and much of the middle class now regard themselves as Independents or Republican instead of Democrats  and the gap    the edge the Democrats had in party registration seems to be narrowing I\\'d like to ask you  Mr  Mondale  what is causing this  Is the Democratic Party out of sync with the majority of Americans  And will it soon be replaced as the majority party by the Republicans  w hat do you think needs to be done about it  as a Democrat MR  MONDALE: My answer is that this campaign isn\\'t over yet  And when people vote  I think you\\'re going to see a very strong verdict by the American people that they favor the approach that I\\'m talking about The American people want arms control  They don\\'t want this arms race  And they don\\'t want this deadly new effort to bring weapons into the heavens  And they want an American foreign policy that leads toward a safer world The American people see this debt  and they know it\\'s got to come down  And if it won\\'t come down  the economy\\'s going to slow down  maybe go into a recession  They see this tremendous influx and swamping of cheap foreign imports in this country that has cost over 3 million jobs  given farmers the worst year in American history  And they know this debt must come down as well  because it\\'s unfair to our children The American people want this environment protected  They know that these toxic waste dumps should have been cleaned up a long time ago  and they know that people\\'s lives and health are being risked  because we\\'ve had an administration that has been totally insensitive to the law and the demand for the protection of the environment The American people want their children educated  They want to get our edge back in science  and they want a policy headed by the President that helps close this gap that\\'s widening between the United States and Europe and Japan The American people want to keep opening doors  They want those civil rights laws enforced  They want the equal rights amendment ratified  They want equal pay for comparable effort for women  And they want it because they\\'ve understood from the beginning that when we open doors  we\\'re all stronger  just as we were at the Olympics I think as you make the case  the American people will increasingly come to our cause MR  w IEGHART: Mr  Mondale  isn\\'t it possible that the American people have heard your message    and they are listening    but they are rejecting it MR  MONDALE: w ell  tonight we had the first debate over the deficit  The President says it\\'ll disappear automatically  I\\'ve said it\\'s going to take some work  I think the American people will draw their own conclusions Secondly  I\\'ve said that I will not support the cuts in Social Security and Medicare and the rest that the President has proposed  The President answers that it didn\\'t happen or  if it did  it was resolved later in a commission  As the record develops  I think it\\'s going to become increasingly clear that what I am saying and where I want to take this country is exactly where the country wants to go  and the comparison of approaches is such that I think will lead to further strength MR  w IEGHART: Mr  President  you and your party are benefiting from what appears to be an erosion of the old Democratic coalition  but you have not laid out a specific agenda to take this shift beyond November 6th  w hat is your program for America for the next decade  with some specificity THE PRESIDENT: w ell  again  I\\'m running on the record  I think sometimes Mr  Mondale\\'s running away from his  But I\\'m running on the record of what we have asked for  w e\\'ll continue to try to get things that we didn\\'t get in a program that has already brought the rate of spending of government down from 17 percent to 6 1 percent  a program of returning authority and autonomy to the local and State governments that has been unjustly seized by the Federal Government  And you might find those words in a Democratic platform of some years ago    I know  because I was a Democrat at that time  And I left the party eventually  because I could no longer follow the turn in the Democratic leadership that took us down an entirely different path  a path of centralizing authority in the Federal Government  lacking trust in the American people I promised  when we took office  that we would reduce inflation  w e have  to one third of what it was  I promised that we would reduce taxes  w e did  25 percent across the board  That barely held even with    if it did that much    with the gigantic tax increase imposed in 1977  But at least it took that burden away from them I said that we would create jobs for our people  and we did    6 million in the last 20 or 21 months  I said that we would become respected in the world once again and that we would refurbish our national defense to the place that we could deal on the world scene and then seek disarmament  reduction of arms  and  hopefully  an elimination of nuclear weapons  w e have done that All of the things that I said we would do  from inflation being down  interest rates being down  unemployment falling  all of those things we have done  And I think this is something the American people see I think they also know that we had a commission that came in a year ago with a recommendation on education    on excellence in education  And today  without the Federal Government being involved other than passing on to them  the school districts  the words from that commission  we find 35 States with task forces now dealing with their educational problems  w e find that schools are extending the curriculum to now have forced teaching of mathematics and science and so forth  All of these things have brought an improvement in the college entrance exams for the first time in some 20 years So  I think that many Democrats are seeing the same thing this Democrat saw: The leadership isn\\'t taking us where we want to go MR  w IEGHART: Mr  President  much of what you said affects the quality of life of many Americans    their income  the way they live  and so forth    but there\\'s an aspect to quality of life that lies beyond the private sector which has to do with our neighborhoods  our cities  our streets  our parks  our environment  In those areas  I have difficulty seeing what your program is and what you feel the Federal responsibility is in these areas of the quality of life in the public sector that affects everybody  and even enormous wealth by one individual can\\'t create the kind of environment that he might like THE PRESIDENT: There are tasks that government legitimately should enforce and tasks that government performs well  and you\\'ve named some of them  Crime has come down the last 2 years  for the first time in many  many decades that it has come down    or since we\\'ve kept records    2 consecutive years  and last year it came down the biggest drop in crime that we\\'ve had  I think that we\\'ve had something to do with that  just as we have with the drug problem nationwide The environment  Yes  I feel as strongly as anyone about the preservation of the environment  w hen we took office  we found that the national parks were so dirty and contained so many hazards  lack of safety features  that we stopped buying additional park land until we had rectified this with what was to be a 5 year program    but it\\'s just about finished already    a billion dollars  And now we\\'re going back to budgeting for additional lands for our parks  w e have added millions of acres to the wilderness lands  to the game refuges  I think that we\\'re out in front of most    and I see that the red light is blinking  so I can\\'t continue  But I\\'ve got more MS  w ALTERS: w ell  you\\'ll have a chance when your rebuttal time comes up  perhaps  Mr  President  Mr  Mondale  now it\\'s your turn for rebuttal MR  MONDALE: The President says that when the Democratic Party made its turn  he left it  The year that he decided we had lost our way was the year that John F  Kennedy was running against Richard Nixon  I was chairman of \"Minnesotans for Kennedy;\\'\\' President Reagan was chairman of a thing called \"Democrats for Nixon \\'\\' Now  maybe we made a wrong turn with Kennedy  but I\\'ll be proud of supporting him all of my life  And I\\'m very happy that John Kennedy was elected  because John Kennedy looked at the future with courage  saw what needed to be done  and understood his own government The President just said that his government is shrinking  It\\'s not  It\\'s now the largest peacetime government ever in terms of the take from the total economy  And instead of retreating    instead of being strong where we should be strong  he wants to make it strong and intervene in the most private and personal questions in American life  That\\'s where government should not be MS  w ALTERS: Mr  President THE PRESIDENT: Before I campaigned as a Democrat for a Republican candidate for President  I had already voted for Dwight Eisenhower to be President of the United States  And so  my change had come earlier than that  I hadn\\'t gotten around to reregistering as yet  I found that was rather difficult to do  But I finally did it There are some other things that have been said here    back  and you said that I might be able to dredge them up  Mr  Mondale referred to the farmers\\' worst year  The farmers are not the victims of anything this administration has done  The farmers were the victims of the double digit inflation and the 21\\\\1/2\\\\ percent interest rates of the Carter Mondale administration and the grain embargo  which destroyed our reliability nationwide as a supplier  All of these things are presently being rectified  and I think that we are going to salvage the farmers  As a matter of fact  there has been less than one quarter of 1 percent of foreclosures of the 270 000 loans from government that the farmers have MS  w ALTERS: Thank you  Mr  President  w e\\'ll now turn to Diane Sawyer for her round of questions Diane AbortionMS  SAw YER: I\\'d like to turn to an area that I think few people enjoy discussing  but that we probably should tonight because the positions of the two candidates are so clearly different and lead to very different policy consequences    and that is abortion and right to life  I\\'m exploring for your personal views of abortion and specifically how you would want them applied as public policy First  Mr  President  Do you consider abortion murder or a sin  And second  how hard would you work    what kind of priority would you give in your second term legislation to make abortion illegal  And specifically  would you make certain  as your party platform urges  that Federal justices that you appoint be prolife THE PRESIDENT: I have believed that in the appointment of judges that all that was specified in the party platform was that they respect the sanctity of human life  Now  that I would want to see in any judge and with regard to any issue having to do with human life  But with regard to abortion  and I have a feeling that this is    there\\'s been some reference without naming it here in the remarks of Mr  Mondale tied to injecting religion into government  w ith me  abortion is not a problem of religion  it\\'s a problem of the Constitution I believe that until and unless someone can establish that the unborn child is not a living human being  then that child is already protected by the Constitution  which guarantees life  liberty  and the pursuit of happiness to all of us  And I think that this is what we should concentrate on  is trying    I know there were weeks and weeks of testimony before a Senate committee  there were medical authorities  there were religious    there were clerics there    everyone talking about this matter of prolife  And at the end of all of that  not one shred of evidence was introduced that the unborn child was not alive  w e have seen premature births that are now grown up  happy people going around Also  there is a strange dichotomy in this whole position about our courts ruling that abortion is not the taking of a human life  In California  sometime ago  a man beat a woman so savagely that her unborn child was born dead with a fractured skull  and the California State Legislature unanimously passed a law that was signed by the then Democratic Governor    signed a law that said that any man who so abuses a pregnant woman that he causes the death of her unborn child shall be charged with murder  Now  isn\\'t it strange that that same woman could have taken the life of her unborn child  and it was abortion and not murder  but if somebody else does it  that\\'s murder  And it used the term \"death of the unborn child \\'\\'So  this has been my feeling about abortion  that we have a problem now to determine    and all the evidence so far comes down on the side of the unborn child being a living human being MS  SAw YER: A two part followup  Do I take it from what you\\'ve said about the platform  then  that you don\\'t regard the language and don\\'t regard in your own appointments  abortion position a test of any kind for justices    that it should be  And also  if abortion is made illegal  how would you want it enforced  w ho would be the policing units that would investigate  And would you want the women who have abortions to be prosecuted THE PRESIDENT: The laws regarding that always were State laws  It was only when the Supreme Court handed down a decision that the Federal Government intervened in what had always been a State policy  Our laws against murder are State laws  So  I would think that this would be the point of enforcement on this As I say  I feel that we have a problem here to resolve  And no one has approached it from that matter  It does not happen that the church that I belong to had that as part of its dogma  I know that some churches do Now  it is a sin if you\\'re taking a human life  At the same time  in our Judeo Christian tradition  we recognize the right of taking a human life in self defense  And therefore  I\\'ve always believed that a mother  if medically it is determined that her life is at risk if she goes through with the pregnancy  she has a right then to take the life of even her own unborn child in defense of her own MS  SAw YER: Mr  Mondale  to turn to you  do you consider abortion a murder or a sin  And bridging from what President Reagan said  he has written that if society doesn\\'t know whether life does    human life  in fact  does begin at conception  as long as there is a doubt  that the unborn child should at least be given the benefit of the doubt and that there should be protection for that unborn child MR  MONDALE: This is one of the most emotional and difficult issues that could possibly be debated  I think your questions  however  underscore the fact there is probably no way that government should or could answer this question in every individual case and in the private lives of the American people The constitutional amendment proposed by President Reagan would make it a crime for a woman to have an abortion if she had been raped or suffered from incest  Is it really the view of the American people  however you feel on the question of abortion  that government ought to be reaching into your livingrooms and making choices like this  I think it cannot work  won\\'t work  and will lead to all kinds of cynical evasions of the law  Those who can afford to have them will continue to have them  The disadvantaged will go out in the back alley as they used to do I think these questions are inherently personal and moral  and every individual instance is different  Every American should be aware of the seriousness of the step  But there are some things that government can do and some things they cannot do Now  the example that the President cites has nothing to do with abortion  Somebody went to a woman and nearly killed her  That\\'s always been a serious crime and always should be a serious crime  But how does that compare with the problem of a woman who is raped  Do we really want those decisions made by judges who\\'ve been picked because they will agree to find the person guilty  I don\\'t think so  and I think it\\'s going in exactly the wrong direction In America  on basic moral questions we have always let the people decide in their own personal lives  w e haven\\'t felt so insecure that we\\'ve reached for the club of state to have our point of view  It\\'s been a good instinct  And we\\'re the most religious people on Earth One final point: President Reagan  as Governor of California  signed a bill which is perhaps the most liberal proabortion bill of any State in the Union MS  SAw YER: But if I can get you back for a moment on my point  which was the question of when human life begins    a two part followup  First of all  at what point do you believe that human life begins in the growth of a fetus  And second of all  you said that government shouldn\\'t be involved in the decisions  Yet there are those who would say that government is involved  and the consequence of the involvement was 1 5 million abortions in 1980  And how do you feel about that MR  MONDALE: The basic decision of the Supreme Court is that each person has to make this judgment in her own life  and that\\'s the way it\\'s been done  And it\\'s a personal and private  moral judgment  I don\\'t know the answer to when life begins  And it\\'s not that simple  either  You\\'ve got another life involved  And if it\\'s rape  how do you draw moral judgments on that  If it\\'s incest  how do you draw moral judgments on that  Does every woman in America have to present herself before some judge picked by Jerry Falwell to clear her personal judgment  It won\\'t work  [Applause]MS  w ALTERS: I\\'m sorry to do this  but I really must talk to the audience You\\'re all invited guests  I know I\\'m wasting time in talking to you  but it really is very unfair of you to applaud    sometimes louder  less loud    and I ask you  as people who were invited here  and polite people  to refrain w e have our time now for rebuttal  Mr  President THE PRESIDENT: Yes  w ell  with regard to this being a personal choice  isn\\'t that what a murderer is insisting on  his or her right to kill someone because of whatever fault they think justifies that Now  I\\'m not capable  and I don\\'t think you are  any of us  to make this determination that must be made with regard to human life  I am simply saying that I believe that that\\'s where the effort should be directed    to make that determination I don\\'t think that any of us should be called upon here to stand and make a decision as to what other things might come under the self defense tradition  That  too  would have to be worked out then  when you once recognize that we\\'re talking about a life  But in this great society of ours  wouldn\\'t it make a lot more sense  in this gentle and kind society  if we had a program that made it possible for when incidents come along in which someone feels they must do away with that unborn child  that instead we make it available for the adoption  There are a million and a half people out there standing in line waiting to adopt children who can\\'t have them any other way MS  w ALTERS: Mr  Mondale MR  MONDALE: I agree with that  and that\\'s why I was a principal sponsor of a liberal adoption law  so that more of these children could come to term  so that the young mothers were educated  so we found an option  an alternative  I\\'m all for that  But the question is whether this other option proposed by the President should be pursued  And I don\\'t agree with it Since I\\'ve got about 20 seconds  let me just say one thing  The question of agriculture came up a minute ago  Net farm income is off 50 percent in the last 3 years  and every farmer knows it  And the effect of these economic policies is like a massive grain embargo  which has caused farm exports to drop 20 percent  It\\'s been a big failure  I opposed the grain embargo in my administration  I\\'m opposed to these policies as well MS  w ALTERS: I\\'m sitting here like the great schoolteacher  letting you both get away with things    because one did it  the other one did it  May I ask in the future that the rebuttal stick to what the rebuttal is  And also  foreign policy will be the next debate  Stop dragging it in by its ear into this one  [Laughter]Now  having admonished you  I would like to say to the panel  you are allowed one question and one followup  w ould you try  as best you could  not to ask two and three    I know it\\'s something we all want to do    two and three questions as part one and two and three as part two Having said that  Fred  it\\'s yours Federal TaxationMR  BARNES: Thank you  Mr  Mondale  let me ask you about middle class Americans and the taxes they pay  Now  I\\'m talking not about the rich or the poor    I know your views on their taxes    but about families earning 25 000 to 45 000 a year  Do you think that those families are overtaxed or undertaxed by the Federal Government MR  MONDALE: In my opinion  as we deal with this deficit  people from about $70 000 a year on down have to be dealt with very  very carefully  because they are the ones who didn\\'t get any relief the first time around Under the 1981 tax bill  people making $200 000 a year got $60 000 in tax relief over 3 years  while people making $30 000 a year  all taxes considered  got no relief at all or their taxes actually went up  That\\'s why my proposal protects everybody from $25 000 a year or less against any tax increases  and treats those $70 000 and under in a way that is more beneficial than the way the President proposes with a sales tax or a flat tax w hat does this mean in real life  w ell  the other day  Vice President Bush disclosed his tax returns to the American people  He\\'s one of the wealthiest Americans  and he\\'s our Vice President  In 1981 I think he paid about 40 percent in taxes  In 1983  as a result of these tax preferences  he paid a little over 12 percent  12 8 percent in taxes  That meant that he paid a lower percent in taxes than the janitor who cleaned up his office or the chauffeur who drives him to work I believe we need some fairness  And that\\'s why I\\'ve proposed what I think is a fair and a responsible proposal that helps protect these people who\\'ve already got no relief or actually got a tax increase MR  BARNES: It sounds as if you are saying you think this group of taxpayers making 25 000 to 45 000 a year is already overtaxed  yet your tax proposal would increase their taxes  I think your aides have said those earning about 25 000 to 35 000  their tax rate would go up    their tax bill would go up a hundred dollars  and from 35 000 to 45 000  more than that  several hundred dollars  w ouldn\\'t that stifle their incentive to work and invest and so on  and also hurt the recovery MR  MONDALE: The first thing is  everybody 25 000 and under would have no tax increase Mr  Reagan  after the election  is going to have to propose a tax increase  and you will have to compare what he proposes  And his Secretary of the Treasury said he\\'s studying a sales tax or a value added tax  They\\'re the same thing  They hit middle  and moderate income Americans and leave wealthy Americans largely untouched Up until about $70 000  as you go up the ladder  my proposals will be far more beneficial  As soon as we get the economy on a sound ground as well  I\\'d like to see the total repeal of indexing  I don\\'t think we can do that for a few years  But at some point  we want to do that as well MR  BARNES: Mr  President  let me try this on you  Do you think middle income Americans are overtaxed or undertaxed THE PRESIDENT: You know  I wasn\\'t going to say this at all  but I can\\'t help it  There you go again  [Laughter] I don\\'t have a plan to tax    or increase taxes  I\\'m not going to increase taxes  I can understand why you are  Mr  Mondale  because as a Senator you voted 16 times to increase taxes Now  I believe that our problem has not been that anybody in our country is undertaxed; it\\'s that government is overfed  And I think that most of our people    this is why we had a 25 percent tax cut across the board which maintained the same progressivity of our tax structure in the brackets on up  And  as a matter of fact  it just so happens that in the quirks of administering these taxes  those above $50 000 actually did not get quite as big a tax cut percentage wise as did those from 50 000 down  From 50 000 down  those people paid two thirds of the taxes  and those people got two thirds of the tax cut Now  the Social Security tax of \\'77    this indeed was a tax that hit people in the lower brackets the hardest  It had two features  It had several tax increases phased in over a period of time    there are two more yet to come between now and 1989  At the same time every year  it increased the amount of money    virtually every year  there may have been one or two that were skipped in there    that was subject to that tax  Today it is up to about $38 000 of earnings that is subject to the payroll tax for Social Security  And that tax  there are no deductions  so a person making anywhere from 10  15  20    they\\'re paying that tax on the full gross earnings that they have after they have already paid an income tax on that same amount of money Now  I don\\'t think that to try and say that we were taxing the rich  and not the other way around  it just doesn\\'t work out that way  The system is still where it was with regard to the progressivity  as I\\'ve said  and that has not been changed  But if you take it in numbers of dollars instead of percentage  yes  you could say  well  that person got 10 times as much as this other person  Yes  but he paid 10 times as much  also  But if you take it in percentages  then you find out that it is fair and equitable across the board MR  BARNES: I thought I caught  Mr  President  a glimmer of a stronger statement there in your answer than you\\'ve made before  I think the operative position you had before was that you would only raise taxes in a second term as a last resort  and I thought you said flatly that \"I\\'m not going to raise taxes \\'\\' Is that what you meant to say  that you will not    that you will flatly not raise taxes in your second term as President THE PRESIDENT: Yes  I had used    \"last resort\\'\\' would always be with me  If you got the Government down to the lowest level  that you yourself could say it could not go any lower and still perform the services for the people  and if the recovery was so complete that you knew you were getting the ultimate amount of revenues that you could get through that growth  and there was still some slight difference there between those two lines  then I had said once that  yes  you would have to then look to see if taxes should not be adjusted I don\\'t foresee those things happening  so I say with great confidence I\\'m not going to go for a tax w ith regard to assailing Mr  Bush about his tax problems and the difference from the tax he once paid and then the later tax he paid  I think if you looked at the deductions  there were great legal expenses in there    had to do  possibly  with the sale of his home  and they had to do with his setting up of a blind trust  All of those are legally deductions  deductible in computing your tax  and it was a 1 year thing with him MS  w ALTERS: Mr  Mondale  here we go again  It\\'s time for rebuttal MR  MONDALE: w ell  first of all  I gave him the benefit of the doubt on the house deal  I\\'m just talking about the 12 8 percent that he paid  and that\\'s what\\'s happening all over this country with wealthy Americans  They\\'ve got so many loopholes they don\\'t have to pay much in taxes Now  Mr  President  you said  \"There you go again \\'\\' right THE PRESIDENT: Yes MR  MONDALE: You remember the last time you said that THE PRESIDENT: Mm hmm MR  MONDALE: You said it when President Carter said that you were going to cut Medicare  and you said  \"Oh  no  there you go again  Mr  President \\'\\' And what did you do right after the election  You went out and tried to cut $20 billion out of Medicare  And so  when you say  \"There you go again\\'\\'    people remember this  you know  [Laughter] And people will remember that you signed the biggest tax increase in the history of California and the biggest tax increase in the history of the United States  and what are you going to do  You\\'ve got a $260 billion deficit  You can\\'t wish it away  You won\\'t slow defense spending; you refuse to do that      MS  w ALTERS: Mr  Mondale  I\\'m afraid your time is up MR  MONDALE: Sorry MS  w ALTERS: Mr  President THE PRESIDENT: Yes  w ith regard to Medicare  no  but it\\'s time for us to say that Medicare is in pretty much the same condition that Social Security was  and something is going to have to be done in the next several years to make it fiscally sound  And  no  I never proposed any $20 billion should come out of Medicare; I have proposed that the program we must treat with that particular problem  And maybe part of that problem is because during the 4 years of the Carter Mondale administration medical costs in this country went up 87 percent MS  w ALTERS: All right  Fine THE PRESIDENT: I gave you back some of that time  [Laughter]MS  w ALTERS: w e can\\'t keep going back for other rebuttals; there\\'ll be time later w e now go to our final round  The way things stand now  we have time for only two sets of questions  and by lot  it will be Jim and Diane  And we\\'ll start with Jim w ieghart Social w elfare ProgramsMR  w IEGHART: Mr  President  the economic recovery is real  but uneven  The Census Bureau  just a month ago  reported that there are more people living under poverty now  a million more people living under it  than when you took office There have been a number of studies  including studies by the Urban Institute and other nonpolitical organizations  that say that the impact of the tax and budget cuts and your economic policies have impacted severely on certain classes of Americans    working mothers  head of households  minority groups  elderly poor  In fact  they\\'re saying the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer under your policies w hat relief can you offer to the working poor  to the minorities  and to the women head of households who have borne the brunt of these economic programs  w hat can you offer them in the future  in your next term THE PRESIDENT: w ell  some of those facts and figures just don\\'t stand up  Yes  there has been an increase in poverty  but it is a lower rate of increase than it was in the preceding years before we got here  It has begun to decline  but it is still going up On the other hand  women heads of household    single women heads of household have    for the first time there\\'s been a turndown in the rate of poverty for them  w e have found also in our studies that in this increase in poverty  it all had to do with their private earnings  It had nothing to do with the transfer of payments from government by way of many programs w e are spending now 37 percent more on food for the hungry in all the various types of programs than was spent in 1980  w e\\'re spending a third more on all of the    well  all of the programs of human service  w e have more people receiving food stamps than were ever receiving them before    2 300 000 more are receiving them    even though we took 850 000 off the food stamp rolls because they were making an income that was above anything that warranted their fellow citizens having to support them  w e found people making 185 percent of the poverty level were getting government benefits  w e have set a line at 130 percent so that we can direct that aid down to the truly needy Some time ago  Mr  Mondale said something about education and college students and help of that kind  Half    one out of two of the full time college students in the United States are receiving some form of Federal aid  But there  again  we found people that there under the previous administration  families that had no limit to income were still eligible for low interest college loans  w e didn\\'t think that was right  And so  we have set a standard that those loans and those grants are directed to the people who otherwise could not go to college  their family incomes were so low So  there are a host of other figures that reveal that the grant programs are greater than they have ever been  taking care of more people than they ever have  7 7 million elderly citizens who were living in the lowest 20 percent of earnings    7 7 million have moved up into another bracket since our administration took over  leaving only 5 million of the elderly in that bracket when there had been more than 13 million MR  w IEGHART: Mr  President  in a visit to Texas    in Brownsville  I believe it was  in the Rio Grande Valley    you did observe that the economic recovery was uneven THE PRESIDENT: Yes MR  w IEGHART: In that particular area of Texas  unemployment was over 14 percent  whereas statewide  it was the lowest in the country  I believe    5 6 percent  And you made the comment  however  that man does not live by bread alone  w hat did you mean by that comment  And if I interpret it correctly  it would be a comment more addressed to the affluent who obviously can look beyond just the bread they need to sustain them  with their wherewithal THE PRESIDENT: That had nothing to do with the other thing of talking about their needs or anything  I remember distinctly  I was segueing into another subject  I was talking about the things that have been accomplished  and that was referring to the revival of patriotism and optimism  the new spirit that we\\'re finding all over America  And it is a wonderful thing to see when you get out there among the people  So  that was the only place that that was used I did avoid  I\\'m afraid  in my previous answer  also  the idea of uneven  yes  There is no way that the recovery is even across the country  just as in the depths of the recession  there were some parts of the country that were worse off  but some that didn\\'t even feel the pain of the recession w e\\'re not going to rest and not going to be happy until every person in this country who wants a job can have one  until the recovery is complete across the country MR  w IEGHART: Mr  Mondale  as you can gather from the question to the President  the celebrated w ar on Poverty obviously didn\\'t end the problem of poverty  although it may have dented it  The poor and the homeless and the disadvantaged are still with us  w hat should the Federal Government\\'s role be to turn back the growth in the number of people living below the poverty level  which is now 35 million in the United States  and to help deal with the structural unemployment problems that the President was referring to in an uneven recovery MR  MONDALE: Number one  we\\'ve got to get the debt down to get the interest rates down so the economy will grow and people will be employed Number two  we have to work with cities and others to help generate economic growth in those communities    through the Urban Development Action Grant Program  I don\\'t mind those enterprise zones; let\\'s try them  but not as a substitute for the others  Certainly education and training is crucial  If these young Americans don\\'t have the skills that make them attractive to employees  they\\'re not going to get jobs The next thing is to try to get more entrepreneurship in business within the reach of minorities so that these businesses are located in the communities in which they\\'re found  The other thing is  we need the business community as well as government heavily involved in these communities to try to get economic growth There is no question that the poor are worse off  I think the President genuinely believes that they\\'re better off  But the figures show that about 8 million more people are below the poverty line than 4 years ago  How you can cut school lunches  how you can cut student assistance  how you can cut housing  how you can cut disability benefits  how you can do all of these things and then the people receiving them    for example  the disabled  who have no alternative    how they\\'re going to do better  I don\\'t know  Now  we need a tight budget  but there\\'s no question that this administration has singled out things that affect the most vulnerable in American life  and they\\'re hurting One final point if I might  There\\'s another part of the lopsided economy that we\\'re in today  and that is that these heavy deficits have killed exports and are swamping the Nation with cheap imports  w e are now $120 billion of imports  3 million jobs lost  and farmers are having their worst year  That\\'s another reason to get the deficit down MR  w IEGHART: Mr  Mondale  is it possible that the vast majority of Americans who appear to be prosperous have lost interest in the kinds of programs you\\'re discussing to help those less privileged than they are MR  MONDALE: I think the American people want to make certain that that dollar is wisely spent  I think they stand for civil rights  I know they\\'re all for education in science and training  which I strongly support  They want these young people to have a chance to get jobs and the rest  I think the business community wants to get involved  I think they\\'re asking for new and creative ways to try to reach it with everyone involved  I think that\\'s part of it  I think also that the American people want a balanced program that gives us long term growth so that they\\'re not having to take money that\\'s desperate to themselves and their families and give it to someone else  I\\'m opposed to that  too MS  w ALTERS: And now it is time for our rebuttal for this period  Mr  President THE PRESIDENT: Yes  The connection that\\'s been made again between the deficit and the interest rates    there is no connection between them  There is a connection between interest rates and inflation  but I would call to your attention that in 1981 while we were operating still on the Carter Mondale budget that we inherited    that the interest rates came down from 21\\\\1/2\\\\  down toward the 12 or 13 figure  And while they were coming down  the deficits had started their great increase  They were going up  Now  if there was a connection I think that there would be a different parallel between deficits getting larger and interest rates going down The interest rates are based on inflation  And right now I have to tell you I don\\'t think there is any excuse for the interest rates being as high as they are because we have brought inflation down so low  I think it can only be that they\\'re anticipating or hope    expecting  not hoping  that maybe we don\\'t have a control of inflation and it\\'s going to go back up again  w ell  it isn\\'t going to go back up  w e\\'re going to see that it doesn\\'t And I haven\\'t got time to answer with regard to the disabled MS  w ALTERS: Thank you  Mr  President MR  MONDALE:MR  MONDALE: Mr  President  if I heard you correctly  you said that these deficits don\\'t have anything to do with interest rates  I will grant you that interest rates were too high in 1980  and we can have another debate as to why    energy prices and so on  There\\'s no way of glossing around that  But when these huge deficits went in place in 1981  what\\'s called the real interest rates    the spread between inflation and what a loan costs you doubled    and that\\'s still the case today  And the result is interest costs that have never been seen before in terms of real charges  and it\\'s attributable to the deficit Everybody    every economist  every businessman    believes that  Your own Council of Economic Advisers    Mr  Feldstein in his report told you that  Every chairman of the Finance and w ays and Means Committee  Republican leaders in the Senate and the House are telling you that  That deficit is ruining the long term hopes for this economy  It\\'s causing high interest rates  It\\'s ruining us in trade  It\\'s given us the highest small business failure in 50 years  The economy is starting downhill with housing failure      MS  w ALTERS: Thank you  Mr  Mondale You\\'re both very obedient  I have to give you credit for that w e now start our final round of questions  w e do want to have time for your rebuttal w e start with Diane    Diane Sawyer Presidential CampaignMS  SAw YER: Since we are reaching the end of the question period  and since in every Presidential campaign  the candidates tend to complain that the opposition candidate is not held accountable for what he or she says  let me give you the chance to do that Mr  Mondale  beginning with you  w hat do you think the most outrageous thing is your opponent said in this debate tonight  [Laughter]MR  MONDALE: Do you want to give me some suggestions  [Laughter] I\\'m going to use my time a little differently  I\\'m going to give the President some credit  I think the President has done some things to raise the sense of spirit  morale  good feeling in this country  and he\\'s entitled to credit for that  w hat I think we need  however  is not just that but to move forward  not just congratulating ourselves but challenging ourselves to get on with the business of dealing with America\\'s problems I think in education  when he lectured the country about the importance of discipline  I didn\\'t like it at first  but I think it helped a little bit  But now we need both that kind of discipline and the resources and the consistent leadership that allows this country to catch up in education and science and training I like President Reagan  And this is not personal    there are deep differences about our future  and that\\'s the basis of my campaign MS  SAw YER: Follow up in a similar vein  then  w hat remaining question would you most like to see your opponent forced to answer MR  MONDALE: w ithout any doubt  I have stood up and told the American people that that $263 billion deficit must come down  And I\\'ve done what no candidate for President has ever done  I told you before the election what I\\'d do Mr  Reagan  as you saw tonight    President Reagan takes the position it will disappear by magic  It was once called voodoo economics  I wish the President would say: Yes  the CBO is right  Yes  we have a $263 billion deficit  This is how I\\'m going to get it done  Don\\'t talk about growth  because even though we need growth  that\\'s not helping  It\\'s going to go in the other direction  as they\\'ve estimated And give us a plan  w hat will you cut  w hose taxes will you raise  w ill you finally touch that defense budget  Are you going to go after Social Security and Medicare and student assistance and the handicapped again as you did last time  If you\\'d just tell us what you\\'re going to do  then the American people could compare my plan for the future with your plan  And that\\'s the way it should be  The American people would be in charge MS  SAw YER: Mr  President  the most outrageous thing your opponent has said in the debate tonight THE PRESIDENT: w ell  now  I have to start with a smile  since his kind words to me I\\'ll tell you what I think has been the most outrageous thing in political dialog  both in this campaign and the one in \\'82  And that is the continued discussion and claim that somehow I am the villain who is going to pull the Social Security checks out from those people who are dependent on them And why I think it is outrageous    first of all  it isn\\'t true  But why it is outrageous is because  for political advantage  every time they do that  they scare millions of senior citizens who are totally dependent on Social Security  have no place else to turn  And they have to live and go to bed at night thinking  \"Is this true  Is someone going to take our check away from us and leave us destitute \\'\\' And I don\\'t think that that should be a part of political dialog Now  to    I still    I just have a minute here MS  w ALTERS: You have more time THE PRESIDENT: Oh  I      MS  w ALTERS: You can keep going THE PRESIDENT: Okay  All right Now  Social Security  let\\'s lay it to rest once and for all  I told you never would I do such a thing  But I tell you also now  Social Security has nothing to do with the deficit  Social Security is totally funded by the payroll tax levied on employer and employee  If you reduce the out go of Social Security  that money would not go into the general fund to reduce a deficit  It would go into the Social Security Trust Fund  So  Social Security has nothing to do with balancing a budget or erasing or lowering the deficit Now  again  to get to whether I am depending on magic  I think I have talked in straight economic terms about a program of recovery that I was told wouldn\\'t work  And then  after it worked  I was told that lowering taxes would increase inflation  And none of these things happened  It is working  and we\\'re going to continue on that same line As to what we might do  and find in further savings cuts  no  we\\'re not going to starve the hungry  But we have 2 478 specific recommendations from a commission of more than 2 000 business people in this country  through the Grace commission  that we\\'re studying right now    and we\\'ve already implemented 17 percent of them    that are recommendations as to how to make government more efficient  more economic MS  SAw YER: And to keep it even  what remaining question would you most like to see your opponent forced to answer THE PRESIDENT: w hy the deficits are so much of a problem for him now  but that in 1976  when the deficit was $52 billion and everyone was panicking about that  he said  no  that he thought it ought to be bigger  because a bigger deficit would stimulate the economy and would help do away with unemployment  In 1979 he made similar statements  the same effect  that the deficits    there was nothing wrong with having deficits Remember  there was a trillion dollars in debt before we got here  That\\'s got to be paid by our children and grandchildren  too  if we don\\'t do it  And I\\'m hoping we can start some payments on it before we get through here  That\\'s why I want another 4 years MS  w ALTERS: w ell  we have time now  if you\\'d like to answer the President\\'s question  or whatever rebuttal MR  MONDALE: w ell  we\\'ve just finished almost the whole debate  And the American people don\\'t have the slightest clue about what President Reagan will do about these deficits  [Laughter] And yet  that\\'s the most important single issue of our time I did support the \\'76 measure that he told about  because we were in a deep recession and we needed some stimulation  But I will say as a Democrat  I was a real piker  Mr  President  In 1979 we ran a $29 billion deficit all year  This administration seems to run that every morning  And the result is exactly what we see  This economy is starting to run downhill  Housing is off  Last report on new purchases  it\\'s the lowest since 1982  Growth is a little over 3 percent now  Many people are predicting a recession  And the flow of imports into this country is swamping the American people w e\\'ve got to deal with this problem  and those of us who want to be your President should tell you now what we\\'re going to do  so you can make a judgment MS  w ALTERS: Thank you very much  w e must stop now  I want to give you time for your closing statements  It\\'s indeed time for that from each of you  w e will begin with President Reagan Oh  I\\'m sorry  Mr  Reagan  you had your rebuttal  and I just cut you off because our time is going  You have a chance now for rebuttal before your closing statement  Is that correct THE PRESIDENT: No  I might as well just go with      MS  w ALTERS: Do you want to go with your      THE PRESIDENT: I don\\'t think so  I\\'m all confused now MS  w ALTERS: Technically  you did  I have little voices that come in my ear  [Laughter] You don\\'t get those same voices  I\\'m not hearing it from here    I\\'m hearing it from here THE PRESIDENT: All right MS  w ALTERS: You have waived your rebuttal  You can go with your closing statement Closing StatementsTHE PRESIDENT: w ell  we\\'ll include it in that MS  w ALTERS: Okay THE PRESIDENT: Four years ago  in similar circumstances to this  I asked you  the American people  a question  I asked: \"Are you better off than you were 4 years before \\'\\' The answer to that obviously was no  and as the result  I was elected to this office and promised a new beginning Now  maybe I\\'m expected to ask that same question again  I\\'m not going to  because I think that all of you    or not everyone  those people that are in those pockets of poverty and haven\\'t caught up  they couldn\\'t answer the way I would want them to    but I think that most of the people in this country would say  yes  they are better off than they were 4 years ago The question  I think  should be enlarged  Is America better off than it was 4 years ago  And I believe the answer to that has to also be \"yes \\'\\' I promised a new beginning  So far  it is only a beginning  If the job were finished  I might have thought twice about seeking reelection for this job But we now have an economy that  for the first time    well  let\\'s put it this way: In the first half of 1980  gross national product was down a minus 3 7 percent  The first half of \\'84 it\\'s up 8\\\\1/2\\\\ percent  Productivity in the first half of 1980 was down a minus 2 percent  Today it is up a plus 4 percent Personal earnings after taxes per capita have gone up almost $3 000 in these 4 years  In 1980    or 1979  a person with a fixed income of $8 000 was $500 above the poverty line  and this maybe explains why there are the numbers still in poverty  By 1980 that same person was $500 below the poverty line w e have restored much of our economy  w ith regard to business investment  it is higher than it has been since 1949  So  there seems to be no shortage of investment capital  w e have  as I said  cut the taxes  but we have reduced inflation  and for 2 years now it has stayed down there  not at double digit  but in the range of 4 or below  w e believe that we had also promised that we would make our country more secure Yes  we have an increase in the defense budget  But back then we had planes that couldn\\'t fly for lack of spare parts or pilots  w e had navy vessels that couldn\\'t leave harbor because of lack of crew or  again  lack of spare parts  Today we\\'re well on our way to a 600 ship navy  w e have 543 at present w e have    our military  the morale is high  I think the people should understand that two thirds of the defense budget pays for pay and salary  or pay and pension  And then you add to that food and wardrobe  and all the other things  and you only have a small portion going for weapons  But I am determined that if ever our men are called on  they should have the best that we can provide in the manner of tools and weapons  There has been reference to expensive spare parts  hammers costing $500  w ell  we are the ones who found those I think we\\'ve given the American people back their spirit  I think there\\'s an optimism in the land and a patriotism  and I think that we\\'re in a position once again to heed the words of Thomas Paine  who said: \"w e have it in our power to begin the world over again \\'\\'MS  w ALTERS: Thank you  Mr  Reagan Mr  Mondale  the closing words are now yours MR  MONDALE: I want to thank the League of w omen Voters and the city of Louisville for hosting this evening\\'s debate  I want to thank President Reagan for agreeing to debate  He didn\\'t have to  and he did  and we all appreciate it The President\\'s favorite question is: Are you better off  w ell  if you\\'re wealthy  you\\'re better off  If you\\'re middle income  you\\'re about where you were  And if you\\'re modest income  you\\'re worse off  That\\'s what the economists tell us But is that really the question that should be asked  Isn\\'t the real question is will we be better off  w ill our children be better off  Are we building the future that this nation needs  I believe that if we ask those questions that bear on our future  not just congratulate ourselves but challenge us to solve those problems  you\\'ll see that we need new leadership Are we better of with this arms race  w ill we be better off if we start this star wars escalation into the heavens  Are we better off when we deemphasize our values in human rights  Are we better off when we load our children with this fantastic debt  w ould fathers and mothers feel proud of themselves if they loaded their children with debts like this nation is now    over a trillion dollars on the shoulders of our children  Can we say  really say that we will be better off when we pull away from sort of that basic American instinct of decency and fairness I would rather lose a campaign about decency than win a campaign about self interest  I don\\'t think this nation is composed of people who care only for themselves  And when we sought to assault Social Security and Medicare  as the record shows we did  I think that was mean spirited  w hen we terminated 400 000 desperate  hopeless  defenseless Americans who were on disability    confused and unable to defend themselves  and just laid them out on the street  as we did for 4 years  I don\\'t think that\\'s what America is all about America is a fair society  and it is not right that Vice President Bush pays less in taxes than the janitor who helps him  I believe there\\'s fundamental fairness crying out that needs to be achieved in our tax system I believe that we will be better off if we protect this environment  And contrary to what the President says  I think their record on the environment is inexcusable and often shameful  These laws are not being enforced  have not been enforced  and the public health and the air and the water are paying the price  That\\'s not fair for our future I think our future requires a President to lead us in an all out search to advance our education  our learning  and our science and training  because this world is more complex and we\\'re being pressed harder all the time I believe in opening doors  w e won the Olympics  in part  because we\\'ve had civil rights laws and the laws that prohibit discrimination against women  I have been for those efforts all my life  The President\\'s record is quite different The question is our future  President Kennedy once said in response to similar arguments  \"w e are great  but we can be greater \\'\\' w e can be better if we face our future  rejoice in our strengths  face our problems  and by solving them  build a better society for our children Thank you MS  w ALTERS: Thank you  Mr  Mondale  [Applause] Please  we have not finished quite yet Thank you  Mr  Mondale  and thank you  Mr  President  And our thanks to our panel members  as well And so we bring to a close this first of the League of w omen Voters Presidential debates of 1984  You two can go at each again in the final League debate on October 21st  in Kansas City

       " 'September 23  1976 Debate TranscriptSeptember 23  1976The First Carter Ford Presidential DebateEDw IN NEw MAN  MODERATOR: Good evening  I\\'m Edwin Newman  moderator of this first debate of the 1976 campaign between Gerald R  Ford of Michigan  Republican candidate for president  and Jimmy Carter of Georgia  Democratic candidate for president  w e thank you  President Ford and we thank you  Governor Carter  for being with us tonight  There are to be three debates between the presidential candidates and one between the vice presidential candidates  All are being arranged by the League of w omen Voters Education Fund  Tonight\\'s debate  the first between presidential candidates in sixteen years and the first ever in which an incumbent president has participated  is taking place before an audience in the w alnut Street Theater in Philadelphia  just three blocks from Independence Hall  The television audience may reach a hundred million in the United States and many millions overseas  Tonight\\'s debate focuses on domestic issues and economic policy  Questions will be put by Frank Reynolds of ABC News  James Gannon of the w all Street Journal  and Elizabeth Drew of the New Yorker magazine  Under the agreed rules the first question will go to Governor Carter  That was decided by the toss of a coin  He will have up to three minutes to answer  One follow up question will be permitted with up to two minutes to reply  President Ford will then have two minutes to respond  The next question will go to President Ford with the same time arrangements  and questions will continue to be alternated between the candidates  Each man will make a three minute statement at the end  Governor Carter to go first  President Ford and Governor Carter do not have any notes or prepared remarks with them this evening  Mr  Reynolds  your question for Governor Carter MR  REYNOLDS: Mr  President  Governor Carter  Governor  in an interview with the Associated Press last week  you said you believed these debates would alleviate a lot of concern that some voters have about you  w ell  one of those concerns  not an uncommon one about uh   candidates in any year  is that many voters say they don\\'t really know where you stand  Now  you have made jobs your number one priority and you have said you are committed to a drastic reduction in unemployment  Can you say now  Governor  in specific terms  what your first step would be next January  if you are elected  to achieve that MR  CARTER: Yes  First of all is to recognize a tremendous economic strength in this country and to set the putting to   back to work of our people as a top priority  This is uh   an effort that ought to be done primarily by strong leadership in the w hite House  the inspiration of our people  the tapping of uh   business  agriculture  industry  labor and government at all levels to work on this uh project  w e\\'ll never have uh   an end to the inflationary spiral  and we\\'ll never have a balanced budget until we get our people back to work  There are several things that can be done specifically that are not now being done  First of all  to channel research and development funds into areas that will provide uh large numbers of jobs  Secondly  we need to have a commitment in the uh private sector uh   to cooperate with government in matters like housing  Here a very small investment of taxpayer\\'s money   in the housing field can bring large numbers of extra jobs  and the guarantee of mortgage loans  and the uh   putting forward of uh   two 0 two programs for housing for older people and so forth to cut down the roughly 20 percent unemployment that now exists in the   in the construction industry  Another thing is to deal with our   uh needs in the central cities  where the unemployment rate is extremely high: sometimes among minority groups  or those who don\\'t speak English  or who\\'re black  or young people  or   40 percent of the employment  Here a CCC type program would be appropriate to channel money into the ah   cha  in   in into the sharing with the private sector and also local and state governments to employ young people who are now out of work  Another very important   uh aspect of our   uh economy would be to increase production in every way possible  uh to hold down   uh taxes on individuals  and to uh shift the tax burdens onto those who have avoided paying taxes in the past  These uh   kinds of specific things  uh none of which are being done now  would be a great help in   in reducing uh unemployment  There is uh   uh an additional factor that needs to be done and covered very   very succinctly  and that is  to make sure that we have a good relationship between management   business on the one hand  and labor  on the other  In a &gt; Transfer interrupted  ery high  we might channel specific uh targeted job   job   uh opportunities by paying part of the salary of unemployed people   uh and also sharing with uh   local governments the uh   payment of salaries which would uh   let us cut down the unemployment rate much lower  before we hit the inflationary level  But I believe that by the end of the first four years of uh   of the next term we could have the unemployment down to 3 percent adult unemployment  which is about uh   4 to 4 and a half percent overall uh controlled inflation rate and have a uh balance of growth of about   uh 4 to 6 percent  around 5 percent which would give us a balanced budget MR  REYNOLDS: Governor  uh   in the event you are successful and you do achieve a drastic dropMR  CARTER: Yes  in unemployment that is likely to create additional pressure on prices  how willing are you to consider an incomes policy  in other words  wage and price controls MR  CARTER: w ell   we now have such uh   a low utilization of uh   our productive capacity   uh about 73 percent; I think it\\'s about the lowest since the Great Depression years   and such a high unemployment rate now   uh 7 9 percent   that   uh we have a long way to go in getting people to work before we have the inflationary pressures  And I think this would uh   this would be uh easy to accomplish  to get jobs down  without having strong in  inflationary pressures that   that would be necessary  I would not favor the uh   payment of uh   of a given fixed income to people unless they are not able to work  But with tax incentives for the low income groups we could build up their uh   income levels uh   above the poverty level and not uh make welfare more uh   profitable than   than work MR  NEw MAN: Mr  President  your response MR  FORD: I don\\'t believe that uh that Mr  Carter\\'s been any more specific in this case than he has been on many other instances  I notice particularly that he didn\\'t endorse the Humphrey Hawkins bill which he has on occasions and which is included as a part of the Democratic platform  That legislation uh allegedly would help our unemployment  but uh   we all know that it would\\'ve controlled our economy  it would\\'ve added uh   ten to thirty billion dollars each year in additional expenditures by the Federal Government  It would\\'ve called for export controls on agricultural products In my judgment the best way to get jobs is to uh   expand the private sector  where five out of six jobs today exist in our economy  w e can do that by reducing Federal taxes as I proposed uh   about a year ago when I called for a tax reduction of $28 billion   three quarters of it to go to private uh taxpayers and uh one quarter to the business sector  w e could add to jobs in the major metropolitan areas by a proposal that I recommended that would give tax incentives to business to move into the inner city and to expand or to build new plants so that they would take a plant  or expand a plant where people are  and people are currently unemployed  w e could uh   also uh   help our youths with some of the proposals that uh   would give to young people an opportunity to work and learn at the same time just like we give money to young people who are going to college  Those are the kind of specifics that I think we have to discuss on these uh   debates  and these are the kind of programs that I\\'ll talk about on my time MR  NEw MAN: Mr  Gannon  your question to President Ford MR  GANNON: Mr  President  I would like to continue for a moment on this uh question of taxes which you have just raised  You have said that you favor more tax cuts for middle income Americans   even those earning up to $30 thousand a year  That presumably would cost the Treasury quite a bit of money in lost revenue  In view of the very large budget deficits that you have accumulated and that are still in prospect  how is it possible to promise further tax cuts and to reach your goal of balancing the budget MR  FORD: At the time  Mr  Gannon  that I made the recommendation for a $28 billion tax cut   three quarters of it to go to individual taxpayers and 25 percent to American business  I said at the time that we had to hold the lid an federal spending  that for every dollar of a tax reduction we had to have an equal reduction in federal expenditures   a one for one proposition  And I recommended that to the Congress with a budget ceiling of three hundred and ninety five billion dollars  and that would have permitted us to have a $25 billion tax reduction  In my tax reduction program for middle income taxpayers  I recommended that the Congress increase personal exemptions from seven hundred and fifty dollars per person to one thousand dollars per person  That would mean  of course  that for a family of four that that family would have a thousand dollars more personal exemption   money that they could spend for their own purposes  money that the government wouldn\\'t have to spend  But if we keep the lid on federal spending  which I think we can   with the help of the Congress  we can justify fully a $28 billion tax reduction  In the budget that I submitted to the Congress in January this year  I re  recommended a 50 percent cutback in the rate of growth of federal spending  For the last ten years the budget of the United States has grown from uh   about 11 percent per year  w e can\\'t afford that kind of growth in federal spending  And in the budget that I recommended we cut it in half   a growth rate of 5 to 5 and one half percent  w ith that kind of limitation  on federal spending  we can fully justify the tax reductions that I have proposed  And it seems to me with the stimulant of more money in the hands of the taxpayers  and with more money in the hands of business to expand  to modernize  to provide more jobs  our economy stimulated so that we\\'ll get more revenue and we\\'ll have a more prosperous economy MR  GANNON: Mr  President  to follow up a moment  uh   the Congress has passed a tax bill which is before you now  which did not meet exactly the uh   sort of outline that you requested  w hat is your intention on that bill  uh   since it doesn\\'t meet your   your requirements  Do you plan to sign that bill MR  FORD: That tax bill does not entirely meet the criteria that I established  I think the Congress should have uh   added another $10 billion reduction in personal income taxes  including the increase of personal exemptions from seven hundred and fifty to a thousand dollars  And Congress could have done that if the budget committees of the Congress  and the Congress as a whole  had not increased the spending that I recommended in the budget  I\\'m sure that you know that in the resolutions passed by the Congress  that have added about $17 billion in more spending  by the Congress over the budget that I recommended  So I would prefer in that tax bill to have an additional tax cut and a further limitation on federal spending  Now this tax bill   that hasn\\'t reached the w hite House yet  but is expected in a day or two   it\\'s about fifteen hundred pages  It has some good provisions in it  It has   uh left out some that I have recommended  unfortunately  On the other hand  uh when you have a bill of that magnitude  with   tho  those many provisions  a president has to sit and decide if there\\'s more good than bad  And from the a  analysis that I\\'ve made so far  it seems to me that that tax bill does uh   justify my signature and my approval MR  NEw MAN: Governor Carter  your response MR  CARTER: w ell  Mr  Ford is   is uh changing uh considerably his previous philosophy  The present tax structure is a disgrace to this country; it\\'s just a welfare program for the rich  As a matter of fact  uh   25 percent of the total tax deductions  go for only 1 percent of the richest people in this country  and over 50 percent of the tax uh credits go for the 14 percent of the richest people in this country  w hen Mr  Ford first became president in   in August of 1974  the first thing he did in   in October was to ask for a $4 7 billion increase in taxes on our people in the midst of the heaviest recession  since uh   since the great depression of nineteen uh   of the 1940s  In uh   January of 1975 he asked for a tax change: a $5 6 billion increase on low and middle income private individuals  a six and a half billion dollar decrease on the corporations and the special interests  In uh   December of uh   1975 he vetoed the roughly 18 to 20 billion dollar uh tax reduction bill that had been passed by the Congress  and then he came back later on in January of this year and he did advocate a $10 billion tax reduction  but it would be offset by a $6 billion increase this coming January in deductions for Social Security payments and for unemployment compensation  The whole philosophy of the Republican party  including uh   my opponent  has been to pile on taxes on low income people to take \\'em off on the corporations  As a matter fact  in   sin  since the late sixties when Mr  Nixon took office  we\\'ve had a reduction in uh   in the percentage of taxes paid by corporations from 30 percent down to about 20 percent  w e\\'ve had an increase in taxes paid by individuals  payroll taxes  from14 Percent up to 20 percent  And this is what the Republicans have done to us  And this is why a tax reform is so important MR  NEw MAN: Mrs  Drew  your question to Governor Carter MS  DREw : Uh Governor Carter  you proposed a number of new or enlarged programs  including jobs  health  welfare reform  child care  aid to education  aid to cities  changes in social security and housing subsidies  You\\'ve also said that you wanna balance the budget by the end of your first term  Now you haven\\'t put a price tag on those programs  but even if we price them conservatively and we count for full employment by the end of your first term  and we count for the economic growth that would occur during that period  there still isn\\'t enough money to pay for those programs and balance the budget by any   any estimates that I\\'ve been able to see  So  in that case what would give MR  CARTER: w ell  as a matter of fact there is  If we assume the ah   uh   a rate of growth of our economy  equivalent to what it was during President Johnson  President Kennedy  even before the   the   the   uh wa uh   Vietnese  namese w ar  and if we assume that at the end of the four year period we can cut our unemployment rate down to 4 to 4 and a half percent   under those circumstances  even assuming no elimination of unnecessary programs and assuming an increase in the ad  in the allotment of money to finance programs  increasing as the inflation rate does   my economic projections  I think confirmed by the House uh   and the Senate committees  have been with the $60 billion extra amount of money that can be spent in fiscal year \\'81 which will be the last year of this next term  w ithin that sixty billion dollars increase there would be fit the programs that I promised the American people  I might say too  that   that if we see that these goals cannot be reached   and I believe they\\'re reasonable goals   then I would cut back on the rate of implement  implementation of new programs in order to accommodate a balanced budget by fiscal year \\'81 which is the last year of the next term  I believe that we ought to have a balanced budget during normal economic circumstances  And uh   these projections have been very carefully made  I stand behind them  And if they should be in error slightly on the down side  then I\\'ll phase in the programs that we\\'ve uh   advocated  more slowly MS  DREw : Governor  uh   according to the budget committees of the Congress tha  tha  tha  that you referred to  if we get to full employment   what they project at a 4 percent unemployment   and  as you say  even allowing for the inflation in the programs  there would not be anything more than a surplus of $5 billion by the end of ninet  by 1981  And conservative estimates of your programs would be that they\\'d be about 85 to a hundred billion dollars  So how   how do you say that you\\'re going to be able to do these things and balance the budget MR  CARTER: w ell  the uh   the assumption that   that you uh   have described as different is in the rate of growth of our economy MS  DREw : No  they took that into account in those figures MR  CARTER: I believe that it\\'s accurate to say that   that the   that the committees to whom you refer with the   the employment that you uh   state  and with the 5 to 5 and a half percent growth rate in our economy  that the uh   projections would be a uh   a $60 billion increase in the amount of money that we\\'d have to spend in l981 compared to now  And uh   with that uh   in that framework would befit the   any improvements in the programs  Now this does not include uh   any uh   uh extra control over uh unnecessary spending  the weeding out of obsolete or obsolescent programs  Uh   we\\'ll have uh   a safety version built in with complete reorganization of the executive branch of government which I am pledged to do  The present bureaucratic structure of the   of the Federal Government is a mess  And if I\\'m elected president that\\'s gonna be a top priority of mine to completely revise the structure of the federal government  to make it economical  efficient  purposeful and manageable for a change  And also  I\\'m going to institute zero based budgeting which I used four years in Georgia  which uh   assesses every program every year  and eliminates those programs that are obsolete or obsolescent  But with these projections  we will have a balanced budget by fiscal year 1981  if I\\'m elected president  Keep my promises to the American people  And it\\'s just predicated on very modest  but I think accurate  projections of employment increases and uh   a growth in our national economy equal to what was experienced under Kennedy  Johnson  before the Vietnam w ar MR  NEw MAN: President Ford MR  FORD: If it is uh true that there will be a $60 billion surplus by fiscal year 1981  rather than spend that money for all the new programs that Governor Carter recommends and endorses  and which are included in the Democratic platform  I think the American taxpayer ought to get an additional tax break   a tax reduction of that magnitude  I feel that the taxpayers are the ones that need the relief: I don\\'t think we should add additional programs of the magnitude that Governor Carter talks about  It seems to me that our tax structure today has rates that are too high  But I am uh   very glad to point out that since 1969  during a Republican administrations  we have had ten million people taken off of the tax rolls at the lower end of the taxpayer area  And at the same time  assuming that I sign the tax bill that was mentioned by Mr  Gannon  we will in the last two tax bills have increased the minimum tax on all wealthy taxpayers  And I believe that by eliminating ten million taxpayers in the last uh eight years  and by putting a heavier tax burden on those in the higher tax brackets  plus the other actions that\\'ve been taken uh   we can give taxpayers adequate tax relief  Now it seems to me that uh   as we look at the recommendations of the budget committees and our own projections  there isn\\'t going to be any $60 billion dividend  I\\'ve heard of those dividends in the past; it always happens  w e expected one at the time of the Vietnam w ar  but it was used up before we ever ended the war and taxpayers never got the adequate relief they deserved MR  NEw MAN: Mr  Reynolds MR  REYNOLDS: Mr  President  when you came into office you spoke very eloquently of the need for a time for healing  and very early in your administration you went out to Chicago and you announced  you proposed a program of uh case by case pardons for draft resisters to restore them to full citizenship  Some fourteen thousand young men took advantage of your offer  but another ninety thousand did not  In granting the pardon to former President Nixon  sir  part of your rationale was to put w atergate behind us to   if I may quote you again   truly end our long national nightmare  w hy does not the same rationale apply now  today  in our Bicentennial year  to the young men who resisted in Vietnam  and many of them still in exile abroad MR  FORD: The amnesty program that I recommended in Chicago in September of 1974 would give to all draft evaders and   uh military deserters the opportunity to earn their uh   good record back  About fourteen to fifteen thousand did take advantage of that program  w e gave them ample time  I am against  an across the board pardon of draft evaders or military deserters  Now in the case of Mr  Nixon  the reason the   the pardon was given  was that  when I took office this country was in a very  very divided condition  There was hatred  there was divisiveness   uh people had lost faith in their government in many  many respects  Mr  Nixon resigned  and I became president  It seemed to me that if I was to uh adequately and effectively handle the problems of high inflation  a growing recession  the uh   involvement of the United States still in Vietnam that I had to give a hundred percent of my time to those two major problems  Mr  Nixon resigned  That is disgrace  The first President out of thirty eight that ever resigned from public office under pressure  So when you look at the penalty that he paid  and when you analyze the requirements that I had   to spend all of my time working on the economy  which was in trouble  that I inherited; working on our problems in Southeast Asia   which were still plaguing us   it seemed to me that Mr  Nixon had been penalized enough by his resignation in disgrace and the need  and necessity for me to concentrate on the problems of the country fully justified the action that I took MR  REYNOLDS: I take it then  sir  that you do not believe that uh   it is   that you are going to reconsider and uh   think about those ninety thousand who are still abroad  Uh   have they not been penalized enough   many of \\'em been there for years MR  FORD: w ell  Mr  Carter has uh indicated that uh   he would give a blanket pardon to all uh   draft evaders  I do not agree with that point of view  I gave  in September of 1974  an opportunity for all draft evaders  all deserters  to come in voluntarily  clear their records by earning an opportunity to restore their good citizenship  I think we gave them a good opportunity   we\\'re   I don\\'t think we should go any further MR  NEw MAN: Governor Carter MR  CARTER: w ell I think it\\'s uh    very difficult for President Ford to uh   explain the difference between the pardon of President Nixon and   and uh   his attitude toward those who violated the draft laws  As a matter of fact   now  I don\\'t advocate amnesty; I advocate pardon  There\\'s a difference in my opinion   uh and in accordance with the ruling of the Supreme Court and accordance with the definition in the dictionary  Amnesty means that   that you uh   that what you did was right  Pardon means that what you did  whether it\\'s right or wrong  you\\'re forgiven for it  And I do advocate a pardon for   for draft evaders  I think it\\'s accurate to say that in uh   two years ago when Mr  Nixon   Mr  Ford put in this uh amnesty that three times as many deserters were uh   excused as were   as were the uh   the ones who evaded the draft  But I think that now is the time to heal our country after the Vietnam w ar and I think that what the people are concerned about is not the   uh pardon or the amnesty of uh   those who evaded the draft  but   but whether or not our crime system is   is fair  w e\\'ve got a   a sharp distinction drawn between white collar crime   the   the   the big shots who are rich  who are influential uh very seldom go to jail; those who are poor and   and who have uh no influence   uh quite often are the ones who are punished  And   and the whole uh subject of crime is one that concerns our people very much  and I believe that the fairness of it is   is what   uh   is a   is a major problem that addresses our   our leader and this is something that hasn\\'t been addressed adequately by   by this administration  But I   I hope to have a complete uh responsibility on my shoulders to help bring about a   a fair uh   criminal justice system and also to   to bring about uh   an end to the   to the divise  divisiveness that has occurred in our country uh as a result of the Vietnam w ar MR  NEw MAN: Mr  Gannon MR  GANNON: Governor Carter  you have promised a sweeping overhaul of the federal government  including a reduction in the number of government agencies   you say it would go down about two hundred from some nineteen hundred  That sounds  indeed  like a very deep cut in the federal government  But isn\\'t it a fact that you\\'re not really talking about fewer federal employees or less government spending  but rather that you are talking about reshaping the federal government  not making it smaller MR  CARTER: w ell  I\\'ve been through this before  Mr  Gannon  as the governor of Georgia  w hen I took aver we had uh a bureaucratic mess  like we have in w ashington now  and we had three hundred agencies  departments  bureaus  commissions   uh some uh   fully budgeted  some not  but all having responsibility to carry out that was in conflict  And we cut those three hundred   uh agencies and so forth down substantially  w e eliminated two hundred and seventy eight of them  w e set up a simple structure of government that could be administrated fairly and it was a   a tremendous success  It hasn\\'t been undone since I was there  It resulted also in an ability to reshape our court system  our prison system  our education system  our mental health programs and   and a clear assignment of responsibility and   and authority and also to have uh our people once again understanding control our government  I intend to do the same thing if I\\'m elected president  w hen I get to w ashington  coming in as an outsider  one of the major responsibilities that   that I will have on my shoulder is a complete reorganization of the   of the executive branch of government  w e now have uh   a greatly expanded w hite House staff  w hen Mr  Nixon went in office  for instance  we had three and a half million dollars spent on   on the w hite House and its staff  That has escalated now to sixteen and a half million dollars  in the last uh Republican administration  This needs to be changed  w e need to put the responsibilities back on the cabinet members  w e also need to have a great reduction in agencies and programs  For instance  we now have uh   in the health area three hundred and two different programs administered by eleven major departments and agencies  sixty other advisory commissions responsible for this  Medicaid\\'s in one agency; Medicare is in a different one  The   the check on the quality of health care is in a different one  None of them uh are responsible for health care itself  This makes it almost impossible for us to have a good health program  w e have uh   just advocated uh   this past week a consolidation of the responsibilities for energy  Our country now has no comprehensive energy program or policy  w e have twenty different agencies in the federal government responsible for the production  the regulation  the uh   information about energy  the conservation of energy  spread all over government  This is a   a gross waste of money  so tough  competent management of government  giving us a simple efficient purposeful and manageable government would be a great step forward and if I\\'m elected   and I intend to be   then it\\'s gonna be done MR  GANNON: w ell  I\\'d like to   to press my question on the number of federal employees   whether you would really plan to reduce the overall   uh number  or   or merely put them in different departments and relabel them  Uh   in your energy plan  you consolidate a number of a   agencies into one  or you would  but uh does that really change the overall MR  CARTER: I can\\'t say for sure that we would have fewer federal employees when I go out of office than when I come in  It took me about three years to completely reorganize the Georgia government  The last year I was in office uh   our budget was   was actually less than it was a year before  uh which showed a great uh improvement  Also  we had a   a 2 percent increase in the number of employees the last year  But it was a tremendous shift from administrative jobs into the delivery of services  For instance  we uh   completely revised our prison system  w e established eighty four new mental health treatment centers  And we shifted people out of administrative jobs into the field to deliver better services  The same thing will be done uh   at the federal government level  I   I accomplished this with s   substantial reductions in employees in some departments  For instance  in the Transportation Department uh we had uh   we cut back about 25 percent of the total number of employees  In giving our people better mental health care  we increased the number of employees  But the efficiency of it  the simplicity of it  the uh ability of people to understand their own government and control it was a   was a uh   substantial benefit derived from complete reorganization  w e uh   have got to do that at the federal government level  If we don\\'t  the bureaucratic mess is going to continue  There\\'s no way for our people now to understand what their government is  There\\'s no way to get the answer to a question  w hen you come to w ashington to try to   as a governor   to try to begin a new program for your people  like uh the treatment of drug addicts  I found there were thirteen different federal agencies that I had to go to  to manage the uh drug treatment program  In the Georgia government we only had one agency responsible for drug treatment  This is the kind of change that would be made  And uh   it would be of   of tremendous benefit in long range planning  in tight budgeting  uh saving the taxpayers\\' money  making the government more efficient  cutting down on bureaucratic waste  having a clear delineation of authority and responsibility of employees  and giving our people a better chance to understand and control their government MR  NEw MAN: President Ford MR  FORD: I think the record should show  Mr  Newman  that uh   the Bureau of Census   we checked it just yesterday   indicates that uh   in the four years that uh   Governor Carter was governor of the state of Georgia  uh   expenditures by the government went up over 50 percent Uh   employees of the government in Georgia during his term of office went up over 25 percent; and the figures also show that the uh  uh   bonded indebtedness of the state of Georgia during his governorship went up over 20 percent  And there was some very interesting testimony given by Governor Carter\\'s successor  Governor Busby  before a Senate committee a few uh   months ago on how he found the Medicaid program when he came into office following Governor Carter  He testified  and these are his words   the present governor of Georgia   he says he found the Medicaid program in Georgia in shambles  Now let me talk about what we\\'ve done in the w hite House as far as federal employees are concerned The first order that I issued after I became president was to cut or eliminate the prospective forty thousand increase in federal employees that had been scheduled by my predecessor  And in the term that I\\'ve been president   some two years   we have reduced federal employment by eleven thousand  In the w hite House staff itself  when I became president  we had roughly five hundred and forty employees  w e now have about four hundred and eighty five employees  so we\\'ve made a rather significant reduction in the number of employees on the w hite House staff working for the president  So I think our record of cutting back employees  plus the failure on the part of the Governor\\'s programs to actually save employment in Georgia  shows which is the better plan MR  NEw MAN: Mrs  Drew MS  DREw : Mr  President  at Vail  after the Republican convention  you announced that you would now emphasize five new areas; among those were jobs and housing and health and improved recreational facilities for Americans  And you also added crime  You also mentioned education  For two years you\\'ve been telling us that we couldn\\'t do very much in these areas because we couldn\\'t afford it; and in fact we do have a $50 billion deficit now  In rebuttal to Governor Carter a little bit earlier  you said that if there were to be any surplus in the next few years you thought it should be turned back to the people in the form of tax relief  So how are you going to pay for any new initiatives in these areas you announced at Vail you were going to now stress MR  FORD: w ell  in the uh   last two years  as I indicated before  we had a very tough time  w e were faced with uh   heavy inflation  over 12 percent; we were faced with substantial unemployment  But in the last uh   twenty four months we\\'ve turned the economy around and we\\'ve brought inflation down to under 6 percent  and we have reduced the uh   well  we have added employment of about four million in the last seventeen months to the point where we have eighty eight million people working in America today   the most in the history of the country  The net result is we are going to have some improvement in our receipts  And I think we\\'ll have some decrease in our disbursements  w e expect to have a lower deficit in fiscal year 1978  w e feel that with this improvement in the economy; we feel with more receipts and fewer disbursements we can in a moderate way increase  as I recommended  over the next ten years a new parks program that would cast a billion and a half dollars  doubling our national park system  w e have recommended that in the h  housing program we can reduce down payments and moderate monthly payments  But that doesn\\'t cost any more as far as the federal treasury is concerned  w e believe that we can uh do a better job in the area of crime  but that requires a tougher sentencing  mandatory certain prison sentences for those who violate our criminal laws  w e   uh believe that uh you can revise the federal criminal code  which has not been revised in a good many years  That doesn\\'t cost any more money  w e believe that you can uhh   do something more effectively with a moderate increase in money in the drug abuse program  w e feel that uh   in education we can have a slight increase   not a major increase  It\\'s my understanding that Governor Carter has indicated that uh   he approves of a $30 billion uh   expenditure by the federal government as far as education is concerned  At the present time we\\'re spending roughly three billion five hundred million dollars  I don\\'t know where that money would come from  But as we look at the quality of life programs   jobs  health  education  crime  recreation   we feel that as we move forward with a healthier economy  we can absorb the small necessary cost that will be required MS  DREw : Sir  in the next few years would you try to reduce the deficit  would you spend more money far these programs that you have just outlined  or would you  as you said earlier  return whatever surplus you got to the people in the form of tax relief MR  FORD: w e feel that uh   with the programs that I have recommended  the additional $10 billion tax cut  with the moderate increases in the quality of life area  we can still have a balanced budget which I will submit to the Congress in January of 1978  w e won\\'t wait one year or two years longer  as Governor Carter uh   indicates  As the economy improves  and it is improving  our gross national product this year will average about 6 percent increase over last year  w e will have the lower rate of inflation for the uh   calendar year this year   something slightly under 6 percent  Employment will be up  revenues will be up  w e\\'ll keep the lid on some of these programs that we can hold down as we have a little extra money to spend for those quality of life programs which I think are needed and necessary  Now I cannot  and would not  endorse the kind of program that uh   Governor Carter recommends  He endorses the Democratic uh   platform which  as I read it  calls for approximately sixty additional programs  w e estimate that those programs would add a hundred billion dollars minimum and probably two hundred billion dollars   uhh maximum each year to the federal budget  Those programs you cannot afford and give tax relief  w e feel that you can hold the line and restrain federal spending  give a tax reduction and still have a balanced budget by 1978 MR  NEw MAN: Governor Carter MR  CARTER: w ell  Mr  Ford takes the uh   same attitude that the Republicans always take  In the last three months before an election  they\\'re always for the programs that they always fight the other three and one half years  Uh   I remember when uh   Herbert Hoover was against uh   jobs for people  I remember when Alf Landon was against Social Security and uh   later President Nixon  sixteen years ago  was telling the public that John Kennedy\\'s proposals would bankrupt the country and would double the cost  The best thing to do is to look at the record uh   of Mr  Ford\\'s Administration and Mr  Nixon\\'s before his  Uh   we had last year a $65 billion deficit   the largest deficit in the history of our country   more of a deficit spending than we had in the entire eight year period under President Johnson and President Kennedy  w e\\'ve got five hundred thousand more Americans out of jobs today than were out of work three months ago and since Mr  Ford\\'s been in office two years  we\\'ve had a 50 percent increase in unemployment from five million people out of work to two and a half million more people out of work and a total of seven and a half million  w e\\'ve also got uh   a comparison between himself and Mr  Nixon  He\\'s got four times the size of the deficits that Mr  Nixon even had himself  This uh   talking about more people at work   uh is distorted because with a 14 percent increase in the cost of living in the last uh   two years  it means that   that women and young people have had to go to work when they didn\\'t want to because their fathers didn\\'t make enough to pay the increased cost of uh   food and uh housing and clothing  w e have uh   in this last uh two years alone a hundred and twenty billion dollars total deficits under President Ford and uh   at the same time we\\'ve had  in the last eight years  a doubling in the number of bankruptcies for small business: we\\'ve had a negative growth in our   in our national economy measured in real dollars  The take home pay of a worker in this country is actually less now than it was in 1968   measured in real dollars  This is the kind of record that\\'s there and talk about the future and a drastic change or conversion on the part of Mr  Ford as of last minute is one that just doesn\\'t go MR  NEw MAN: Mr  Reynolds MR  REYNOLDS: Governor Carter  I\\'d like to turn uh   to what we used to call the energy crisis  Yesterday a British uh   government commission on air pollution  but one headed by a nuclear physicist  recommended that any further expansion of nuclear energy be delayed in Britain as long as possible  Now this is a subject that is quite controversial among our own people and there seems to be a clear difference between you and the President on the use of nuclear power plants  which you say you would use as a last priority  w hy  sir  are they unsafe MR  CARTER: w ell among my other experiences in the past  I\\'ve   I\\'ve been a nuclear engineer  and did graduate work in this field  I think I know the   the uh capabilities and limitations of atomic power  But the energy   uh policy of our nation is one that uh has not yet been established under this administration  I think almost every other developed nation in the world has an energy policy except us  w e have seen uh   the Federal Energy Agency established  for instance  Uh   in the crisis of 1973 it was supposed to be a temporary agency  uh now it\\'s permanent  it\\'s enormous  it\\'s growing every day  I think the w all Street Journal uh reported not too long ago they have a hundred and twelve public relations experts working for the Federal Energy Agency to try to justify to the American people its own existence  w e\\'ve got to have a   a firm way to handle the energy question  The reorganization proposal that I have put forward is one uh first step  In addition to that  we need to have   uh a realization that we\\'ve got uh about thirty five years worth of oil left in the whole world  w e\\'re gonna run out of oil  w hen Mr  Nixon made his famous uh speech on Operation Independence we were importing about 35 percent of our oil  Now we\\'ve increased that amount 25 percent  w e now import about 44 percent of our oil  w e need to shift from oil to coal  w e need to concentrate our research and development effort on uh coal burning and extraction  with safer mines  but also it\\'s clean burning  w e need to shift very strongly toward solar energy and have strict conservation measures  And then as a last resort only  continue to use atomic power  I would certainly uh   not cut out atomic power altogether  w e can\\'t afford to give up that opportunity until later  But to the extent that we continue to use atomic power  I would be responsible as president to make sure that the safety precautions were initiated and maintained  For instance  some that have been forgotten; we need to have the reactor core   below ground level  the entire power plant that uses atomic uh   power tightly sealed and a heavy   heavy vacuum maintained  There ought to be a standardized design  There ought to be a full time uh   atomic energy specialist  independent of the power company in the control room  full time  twenty four hours a day  to shut down a plant if an abnormality develops  These kinds of uh   procedures  along with evacuation procedures  adequate insurance  ought to be initiated  So  shift from oil to coal  emphasize research and development on coal use and also on solar power  strict conservation measures  not yield every time that the special interest groups uh   put pressure on the president like uh this administration has done  and use atomic energy only as a last resort with the strictest possible safety precautions  That\\'s the best overall energy policy in the brief time we have to discuss it MR  REYNOLDS: w ell Governor  on that same subject  would you require mandatory conservation efforts to try to conserve fuel MR  CARTER: Yes  I would  Some of the things that can be done about this is a change in the rate structure of electric power companies  w e uh   now encourage people to waste electricity  and uh   by giving uh   the lowest rates to the biggest users  w e don\\'t do anything to cut down on peak load requirements  w e don\\'t have an adequate requirement for the insulation of homes  for the efficiency of automobiles  And whenever the uh   automobile manufacturers come forward and say they can\\'t meet the uh   amendments that the Congress has put forward  this Republican administration has delayed the implementation dates  In addition to that  we ought to have a   a shift toward the use of coal  particularly in the Appalachian regions where the coal is located  A lot of uh   very high quality  low carbon coal  uh   low sulfur coal is there  it\\'s where our employment is needed  Uh   this would   would help a great deal  So mandatory conservation measures   yes  Encouragement by the president for people to uh voluntarily conserve   yes  And also the private sector ought to be encouraged to   to bring forward to the public the benefits from efficiency  One bank in uh   w ashington  fo  for instance  gives lower interest loans for people who adequately insulate their homes or who buy efficient automobiles  And some major uh   uh   manufacturing companies  like Dow Chemical  have through uh   very effective efficiency mechanism cut down the use of energy by uh   as much as 40 percent with the same out product  These kinds of things uh   ought to be done  uh they ought to be encouraged and supported  and even required uh by the government  yes MR  NEw MAN: President Ford MR  FORD: Governor Carter skims over a very serious and a very broad subject  In January of uh   1975 I submitted to the Congress and to the American people the first comprehensive energy program recommended by any president  It called for an increase in the production of energy in the United States  It called for uh   conservation measures so that we would save the energy that we have  If you\\'re going to increase domestic oil and gas production   and we have to   you have to give those producers an opportunity to uh   develop their land or their wells  I recommended to the Congress that we should increase production in this country from six hundred million tons a year to twel  a  a billion two hundred million tons by 1985  In order to do that we have to improve our extraction of coal from the ground; we have to improve our utilization of coal   make it more efficient  make it cleaner  In addition we uh   have to expand our research and development  In my program for energy independence we have increased  for example  solar energy research from about $84 million a year to about a hundred and twenty million dollars a year  w e\\'re going as fast as the experts say we should  In nuclear power we have increased the research and development  uh   under the Energy Research and Development Agency uh   very substantially  to insure that our ener  uh   nuclear power plants are safer  that they are more efficient  and that we have adequate safeguards  I think you have to have greater oil and gas production  more coal production  more nuclear production  and in addition you have to have energy conservation MR  NEw MAN: Mr  Gannon MR  GANNON: Mr  President  I\\'d like to return for a moment to this problem of unemployment  You have vetoed or threatened to veto number of job bills passed or uh   in development in the Democratic Congress   Democratic controlled Congress  Yet at the same time the government is paying out  uh   I think it is $17 billion  perhaps $20 billion a year in unemployment compensation caused by the high unemployment  w hy do you think it is better to pay out unemployment compensation to idle people than to put them to work in public service jobs MR  FORD: The bills that I vetoed  the one for an additional $6 billion  was not a bill that would have solved our unemployment problems  Even the proponents of it admitted that no more than four hundred thousand jobs would be uh   made available  Our analysis indicates that something in the magnitude of about one hundred fifty to two hundred thousand jobs would uh   be made available  Each one of those jobs would\\'ve cost the taxpayers $25 thousand  In addition  the jobs would not be available right now  They would not have materialized for about nine to eighteen months  The immediate problem we have is to stimulate our economy now so that we can get rid of unemployment  w hat we have done is to hold the lid on spending in an effort to reduce the rate of inflation  And we have proven  I think very conclusively  that you can reduce the rate of inflation and increase jobs  For example  as I have said  we have added some four million jobs in the last seventeen months  w e have now employed eighty eight million people in America  the largest number in the history of the United States  w e\\'ve added five hundred thousand jobs in the last two months  Inflation is the quickest way to destroy jobs  And by holding the lid on federal spending we have been able to do an  a good job  an affirmative job in inflation and as a result have added to the jobs in this country  I think it\\'s uh   also appropriate to point out that through our tax policies we have stimulated uhh   added employment throughout the country  the investment tax credit  the tax incentives for expansion and modernization of our industrial capacity  It\\'s my   my opinion that the private sector  where five out of six jobs are  where you have permanent jobs  with the opportunity for advancement  is a better place than make work jobs under the program recommended by the Congress MR  GANNON: Just to follow up  Mr  President: the   the Congress has just passed a three point seven billion dollar appropriation bill which would provide money for the public works jobs program that you earlier tried to kill by your veto of the authorization legislation  In light of the fact that uh   unemployment again is rising   or has in the past three months   I wonder if you have rethought that question at all; whether you would consider uh   allowing this program to be funded  or will you veto that money bill MR  FORD: w ell  that bill has not yet come down to the Oval Office  so I am not in a position to make any judgment on it tonight  But that is an extra $4 billion that would uh   add to the deficit which would add to the inflationary pressures  which would help to destroy jobs in the private sector   not make jobs  where the jobs really are  These make work  temporary jobs   dead end as they are   are not the kind of jobs that we want for our people  I think it\\'s interesting to point out that uh   in the uh   two years that I\\'ve been president I\\'ve vetoed fifty six bills  Congress has sustained forty two vetoes  As a result  we have saved over $9 billion in federal expenditures  And the Congress by overriding the bills that I did veto  the Congress has added some $13 billion to the federal expenditures and to the federal deficit  Now Governor Carter complains about the deficits that uh   uh   this administration has had  And yet he condemns the vetoes that I have made that has   that have saved the taxpayer $9 billion and could have saved an additional $13 billion  Now he can\\'t have it both ways  And therefore  it seems to me that we should hold the lid  as we have  to the best of our ability so we can stimulate the private economy and get the jobs where the jobs are   five out of six in this economy MR  NEw MAN: Governor Carter MR  CARTER: w ell  Mr  Ford doesn\\'t seem to put into perspective the fact that when   when uh five hundred thousand more people are out of work than there were three months ago  while we have two and a half million more people out of work than were when he took office  that this touches human beings  I was in uh   a city in uh   Pennsylvania not too long ago  near here  and uh   there were about four or five thousand people in the audience   it was on a   on a train trip  And I said  \"How many uh   adults here are out of work \" About a thousand raised their hands  Mr  Ford uh   actually has fewer people now in the private sector in non farm jobs than when he took office  And still he talks about   uh success  Seven point nine percent unemployment is a terrible tragedy in this country  He says he\\'s learned how to match unemployment with inflation  That\\'s right  w e\\'ve got the highest inflation we\\'ve had in twenty five years right now  except under this administration  and that was fifty years ago  And we\\'ve got uh   the highest unemployment we\\'ve had uh   under Mr  Ford\\'s administration  since the Great Depression  This affects human beings  and   and his insensitivity in providing those people a chance to work has made this a welfare administration  and not a work administration  He hasn\\'t saved $9 billion with his vetoes  There\\'s only been uh   a net savings of $4 billion  And the cost in unemployment compensation  welfare compensation  and lost revenues has increased $23 billion in the last two years  This is a   a typical attitude that really causes havoc in people\\'s lives  and then it\\'s covered over by saying that our country has naturally got a 6 percent unemployment rate  or 7 percent unemployment rate and a 6 percent inflation  It\\'s a travesty  It shows a lack of leadership  And we\\'ve never had a president since the w ar between the States that vetoed more bills  Mr  Ford has vetoed four times as many bills as Mr  Nixon   per year  And eleven of \\'em have been overridden  One of his bills that was overridden   he only got one vote in the Senate and seven votes in the House  from Republicans MR  NEw MAN: Governor Carter  So this shows a breakdown in leadership MR  NEw MAN: Under the rules  I must stop you there  And Mrs  Drew MS  DREw : Governor Carter  I\\'d like to come back to the subject of taxes  You have said that you want to cut taxes for the middle and lower income groups MR  CARTER: Right MS  DREw : But unless you\\'re willing to do such things as reduce the itemized deductions for charitable contributions or home mortgage payments  or interest  or taxes  or capital gains  you can\\'t really raise sufficient revenue to provide an overall tax cut of any size  So how are you gonna provide that tax relief that you\\'re talking about MR  CARTER: Now we have uh such a grossly unbalanced tax system   as I said earlier  that it is a disgrace   ah of all the tax   benefits now  25 percent of \\'em go to the 1 percent of the richest people in this country  Over 50 percent   53 to be exact   percent of the tax benefits go to the 14 percent richest people in this country  and we\\'ve had a 50 percent increase in payroll deductions since Mr  Nixon went in office eight years ago  Mr  Ford has   has advocated since he\\'s been in office over $5 billion in reductions for corporations  special interest groups  and the very  very wealthy who derive their income   not from labor   but from investments  That\\'s got to be changed  A few things that can be done: we have now a deferral system so that the multinational corporations who invest overseas   if they make a million dollars in profits overseas   they don\\'t have to pay any of their taxes unless they bring their money back into this country  w hen they don\\'t pay their taxes  the average American pays the taxes for them  Not only that  but it robs this country of jobs  because instead of coming back with that million dollars and creating a shoe factory  say in New Hampshire or Vermont  if the company takes the money down to Italy and   and builds a shoe factory  they don\\'t have to pay any taxes on the money  Another thing is a system called DISC which was originally designed  proposed by Mr  Nixon  to encourage exports  This permits a company to create uh   a dummy corporation  to export their products  and then not to pay the full amount of taxes on them  This costs our uh   government about uh   $1 4 billion a year  And when those rich corporations don\\'t pay that tax  the average American taxpayer pays it for \\'em  Another one that\\'s uh   that\\'s very important is the uh   is the business deductions  uh   jet airplanes  uh   first class travel  the fifty dollar martini lunch  The average working person can\\'t   uh   can\\'t take advantage of that  but the   the wealthier people   uh can  Uh   another system is where uhh   a dentist can invest money in say  raising cattle and uh   can put in a hundred thousand dollars of his own money  borrow nine hundred thousand dollars   nine hundred mi  thousand dollars   that makes a million   and mark off a great amount of uh   of loss uh   through that procedure  Uh   there was one example  for instance  where uh   somebody uh   produced pornographic movies  They put in $30 thousand of their own money and got a hundred and twenty thousand dollars in tax savings  w ell  these special kinds of programs have   have robbed the average taxpayer and have benefited those who are powerful  and who can employ lobbyists  and who can have their CPAs and their lawyers to help them benefit from the roughly uh   eight thousand pages of the tax code  The average uh American person can\\'t do it  You can\\'t hire a lobbyist uh out of unemployment compensation checks MS  DREw : Ah   Governor  to follow up on your answer  Uh   in order for any kind of tax relief to really be felt by the middle and lower income peopleMR  CARTER: Yes  You need about  according to Congressional committees on this  you need about $10 billion  Now you listed some things   the uh   deferral on foreign income as estimated: that would save about $500 million  DISC  you said  was about 1 4 billion  uh   The estimate of the outside  if you eliminated all tax shelters  is 5 billion  So where else would you raise the revenue to provide this tax relief   would you  in fact  do away with all business deductions  and what other kinds of preferences would you do away with MR  CARTER: No  I wouldn\\'t do away with all   uh business deductions  I think that would be a   a very serious mistake  But uh   if   if you could just do away with the ones that are unfair  you could lower taxes for everyone  I would never do anything that would increase the taxes for those who work for a living  or who are presently required to list all their income  w hat I wanna do is not to raise taxes  but to eliminate loopholes  And this is uh   the point of my first statistics that I gave you   that   that the present tax benefits that have been carved out over a long period of years   fifty years   by sharp tax lawyers and by lobbyists have benefited just the rich  These programs that I described to you earlier   the tax deferrals for overseas  the DISC  and the tax shelters  uh   they only apply to people in the $50 thousand a year bracket or up  and I think this is the very best way to approach it  It\\'s to make sure that everybody pays taxes on the income that they earn and make sure that you take whatever savings there is from the higher income levels and give it to the lower  and middle income families MR  NEw MAN: President Ford MR  FORD: Governor Carter\\'s answer tonight does not coincide with the answer that he gave in an interview to the Associated Press a week or so ago  In that interview uh   Governor Carter indicated that uh   he would raise the taxes on those in the medium or middle income brackets or higher  Now if you uh   take the medium or middle income taxpayer   that\\'s about $14 thousand per person   uh   Governor Carter has indicated  publicly  in an interview that he would increase the taxes on about 50 percent of the working people of this country  I think uh   the way to get tax equity in this country is to give tax relief to the middle income people who have an income from roughly $8 thousand up to twenty five or thirty thousand dollars  They have been short changed as we have taken ten million taxpayers off the tax rolls in the last eight years  and as we have uh   added to the minimum tax uh   provision to make all people pay more taxes  I believe in tax equity for the middle income taxpayer  increasing the personal exemption  Mr  Carter wants to increase taxes for roughly half of the taxpayers of this country  Now  the Governor has also played a little fast and loose with the facts about vetoes  The records show that President Roosevelt vetoed an average of fifty five bills a year  President Truman vetoed on the average  while he was president  about thirty eight bills a year  I understand that Governor Carter  when he was Governor of Georgia  vetoed between thirty five and forty bills a year  My average in two years is twenty six  But in the process of that we have saved uhh   $9 billion  And one final comment  uh   Governor Carter talks about the tax bills and all of the inequities that exist in the present law  I must remind him the Democrats have controlled the Congress for the last twenty two years and they wrote all the tax bills MR  NEw MAN: Mr  Reynolds MR  REYNOLDS: I suspect that uhh   we could continue on this tax argument for some time  But I\\'d like to move on to another area  Mr  President  uh everybody seems to be running against w ashington this year  And I\\'d like to raise two coincidental events and ask you whether you think perhaps this may have a bearing on the attitude throughout the country  The House Ethics Committee has just now ended its investigation of Daniel Schorr  after several months and many thousands of dollars  trying to find out how he obtained and caused to be published a report of the Congress that probably is the property of the American people  At the same time  the Senate Select Committee on Standards and Conduct has voted not really to begin an investigation of a United States senator because of allegations against him that he may have been receiving corporate funds illegally over a period of years  Do you suppose  sir  that events like this contribute to the feeling in the country that maybe there\\'s something wrong in w ashington  and I don\\'t mean just in the executive branch but throughout the whole government MR  FORD: There is a considerable anti w ashington feeling throughout the country  But I think the feeling is misplaced  In the last two years  we have restored integrity in the w hite House  and we\\'ve set high standards in the executive branch of the government  The anti w ashington feeling  in my opinion  ought to be focused on the Congress of the United States  For example  this Congress  very shortly  will spend a billion dollars a year for its housekeeping  its salaries  its expenses and the like  It   the next Congress will probably be the first billion dollar Congress in the history of the United States  I don\\'t think the American people are getting their money\\'s worth from the majority party that run this Congress  w e  in addition  see that uh   in the last uh   four years the number of employees hired by the Congress has gone up substantial  uh much more than uh   the gross national product  much more than any other increase throughout our society  Congress is hiring people by the droves  and the cast as a result has gone up  And I don\\'t see any improvement in the performance of the Congress under the present leadership  So it seems to me instead of the anti w ashington feeling being aimed at everybody in w ashington  it seems to me that the focus should be where the problem is  which is the Congress of the United States  and particularly the majority in the Congress  They spend too much money on themselves  They have too many employees  There\\'s some question about their morality  It seems to me that in this election  the focus should not be on the executive branch but the corrections should come as the voters vote for their members of the House of Representatives or for their United States senator  That\\'s where the problem is and I hope there\\'ll be some corrective action taken so we can get some new leadership in the Congress of the United States MR  REYNOLDS: Mr  President  if I may follow up  Uh   I think you\\'ve made it plain that you take a dim view of the uh   majority in the Congress  Isn\\'t it quite likely  sir  that you will have a Democratic Congress in the next session  if you are elected president  And hasn\\'t the country uh   a right to ask whether you can get along with that Congress  or whether we\\'ll have continued confrontation MR  FORD: w ell  It seems to me that uh   we have a chance   the Republicans   to get a majority in the House of Representatives  w e will make some gains in the United States Senate  So there will be different ratios in the House  as well as in the Senate  and as president I will be able to uh   work with that Congress  But let me take the other side of the coin  if I might  Supposing we had   had a Democratic Congress for the last two years and we\\'d had uh   Governor Carter as President  He has  in effect  said that he would agree with all of   he would disapprove of the vetoes that I have made  and would have added significantly to expenditures and the deficit in the federal government  I think it would be contrary to one of the basic concepts in our system of government   a system of checks and balances  w e have a Democratic Congress today  and fortunately we\\'ve had a Republican president to check their excesses with my vetoes  If we have a Democratic Congress next year  and a president who wants to spend an additional one hundred billion dollars a year  or maybe two hundred billion dollars a year  with more programs  we will have in my judgment  greater deficits with more spending  more dangers of inflation  I think the American people want a Republican president to check on any excesses that come out of the next Congress  if it is a Democratic Congress MR  NEw MAN: Governor Carter MR  CARTER: w ell  it\\'s not a matter of uh   Republican and Democrat  It\\'s a matter of leadership or no leadership  President Eisenhower worked with a Democratic Congress very well  Even President Nixon  because he was a strong leader at least  worked with a Democratic Congress very well  Uh   Mr  Ford has vetoed  as I said earlier  four times as many bills per year as Mr  Nixon  Mr  Ford quite often puts forward a program just as a public relations stunt  and never tries to put it through the Congress by working with the Congress  I think under presidents For  uh   Nixon and Eisenhower they passed about 60 to 75 percent of their legislation  This year Mr  Ford will not pass more than 26 percent of all the legislative proposals he puts forward  This is government by stalemate  and we\\'ve seen almost a complete breakdown in the proper relationship between the president  who represents this country  and the Congress  who collectively also represent this country  w e\\'ve had uh   Republican presidents before who\\'ve tried to run against a Democratic   uh Congress  And I don\\'t think it\\'s uh   the Congress is Mr  Ford\\'s opponent; but if uh   if   if he insists that uh   that I be responsible for the Democratic Congress  of which I\\'m   have not been a part  then I think it\\'s only fair that he be responsible for the Nixon administration in its entirety  of which he was a part  That  I think  is a good balance  But the point is  that   that a president ought to lead this country  Mr  Ford  so far as I know  except for avoiding another w atergate  has not accomplished one single major program for this country  And there\\'s been a constant squabbling between the president and the Congress  and that\\'s not the way this country ought to be run  I might go back to one other thing  Mr  Ford has uh   misquoted an AP uh   news story that was in error to begin with  That story reported several times that I would lower taxes for low and middle income families and uh   that correction was delivered to the w hite House and I am sure that the president knows about this uh   correction  but he still insists uh   on repeating an erroneous statement MR  NEw MAN: President Ford  Governor Carter  we no longer have enough time for two complete sequences of questions  w e have only about six minutes left for questions and answers  For that reason we will drop the follow up questions at this point but each candidate will still be able to respond to the other\\'s answers  Uh   to the extent that you can  gentlemen  please keep your remarks brief  Mr  Gannon MR  GANNON: Governor Carter  one uh   important uh   part of the Government\\'s economic policy uh   apparatus we haven\\'t talked about is the Federal Reserve Board  I\\'d like to ask you something about what you\\'ve said and that is that uh   you believe that a president ought to have a chairman of the Federal Reserve Board whose views are compatible with his own  Based on the record of the last few years  would you say that your views are compatible with those of Chairman Arthur Burns  And if not  would you seek his resignation if you are elected MR  CARTER: w hat I have said is that the president ought to have a chance to appoint a chairman of the Federal Reserve Board to have a coterminous uh term; in other words  both of \\'em serve the same four   four years  The Congress can modify the supply of money by modifying the income uh tax laws  The president can modify the uh   economic structure of a country by public statements and general attitudes in the budget that he proposes  The Federal Reserve has uh   an independent status that ought to be preserved; I think that Mr  uh   Burns did take a typical  erroneous Republican attitude in the 1973 year when inflation was so high  They assumed that the uh   inflation rate was because of excessive demand and uh   therefore put into effect tight constraint on the economy  very high interest rates  which is typical also of the Republican administration  uh   tried to increase the uh   the tax uh   payments by individuals  and cut the tax payments by corporations  I would have uh   done it opposite  I think the uh   problem should\\'ve been addressed by increasing productivity  by having uh   put   put people back to work so they could purchase more goods  lower income taxes on individuals  perhaps raise them  if necessary  on corporations in comparison  But uh   Mr  Burns uh   in that respect made a very serious mistake  I would not wanna destroy the   the independence of the uh Federal Reserve   uh Board  But I do think we ought to have a cohesive economic policy with at   at least the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board and the president\\'s terms being uh   the same and letting the Congress  of course  be the third uh   entity with uh   with independence subject only to the president\\'s veto MR  NEw MAN: President Ford  your response MR  FORD: The chairman of the Federal Reserve Board should be independent  Fortunately  he has been during Democratic as well as Republican administrations  As the result in the last uh   two years uh   we have had a responsible monetary policy  Uh the Federal Reserve Board indicated that the supply of money would be held between four to four and a half and seven and seven and a half  They have done a good job in integrating the money supply with the uh   fiscal policy of the uh   executive and legislative branches of the government  It would be catastrophic if the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board became the tool of the political uh   party that was in power  It\\'s important for our future uhh   economic security that that job be nonpolitical and uh   separate from the executive and the Legislative branches MR  NEw MAN: Mrs  Drew MS  DREw : Uh Mr  President  the real problem with the FBI and  in fact  all of the intelligence agencies is there are no real laws governing them  Such laws as there are tend to be vague and open ended  Now  you have issued some executive orders  but we\\'ve learned that leaving these agencies to executive discretion and direction can get them and  in fact  the country in a great deal of trouble  One president may be a decent man  the next one might not be  So  what do you think about trying to write in some more protection by getting some laws governing these agencies MR  FORD: You are familiar  of course  with the fact that I am the first president in thirty years who has reorganized the intelligence agencies in the federal government: the CIA  the Defense Intelligence Agency  the National Security Agency and the others  w e\\'ve done that by executive order  Uhh   and I think uh   we\\'ve tightened it up; we\\'ve uh   straightened out their problems that developed over the last few years  It doesn\\'t seem to me that it\\'s needed or necessary to have legislation in this particular regard  Uhh   I have recommended to the Congress  however   I\\'m sure you\\'re familiar with this   legislation that would uhh   make it uhh   very uhh   proper in   in the right way  that the attorney general could go in and get the right for wiretapping under security cases  This was an effort that was made by the attorney general and myself  working with the Congress  But even in this area  where I think new legislation would be justified  uh the Congress has not responded  So  I feel in that case  as well as in the reorganization of the intelligence agencies  as I\\'ve done  we have to do it by executive order  And I\\'m glad that we have a good director in George Bush  w e have good executive orders  and the CIA and the DIA and NASA uh   uh   NSA are now doing a good job under proper supervision MR  NEw MAN: Governor Carter MR  CARTER: w ell  one of the very serious things that\\'s happened in our government in recent years  and has continued up until now  is a breakdown in the trust among our people in the [twenty seven minute delay]MR  NEw MAN: failure in the broadcasting of the debate  it occurred twenty seven minutes ago  Uh the fault has been dealt with and uh   we want to thank President Ford and Governor Carter for being so patient and understanding while this uh delay went on  Uh we very much regret the technical failure that lost the sound as it   as it was leaving this theater  It occurred during uh Governor Carter\\'s response to what would have been and what was the last question put to the candidates  That question went to President Ford  It dealt with the control of government intelligence agencies  Uh Governor Carter was making that response and had very nearly finished it  Uh   he wil1 conclude his response now after which uh   President Ford and Governor Carter will make their closing statements  Governor MR  CARTER: There has been too much government secrecy and not uh   not enough respect for the personal privacy of American citizens MR  NEw MAN: It is now time for the closing statements  which are to be up to four minutes long  Governor Carter  by the same toss of the coin that directed the first question to you  you are to go first now MR  CARTER: w ell  tonight we\\'ve had a chance to talk a lot about the past  But I think it\\'s time to talk about the future  Our nation in the last eight years has been divided as never before  It\\'s a time for unity  It\\'s a time to draw ourselves together: to have a president and a Congress that can work together with mutual respect for a change  cooperating for a change  in the open for a change  so the people can understand their own government  It\\'s time for government  industry  labor  manufacturing  agriculture  education  other entities in our society to cooperate  And it\\'s a time for government to understand and to cooperate with our people  For a long time our American citizens have been excluded  sometimes misled  sometimes have been lied to  This is uh   not compatible with the purpose of our nation  I believe in our country  It needs to be competent  The government needs to be well managed  efficient  economical  w e need to have a government that\\'s sensitive to our people\\'s needs   to those who are poor  who don\\'t have adequate health care  who have been cheated too long with our tax programs  who\\'ve been out of jobs  whose families have been torn apart  w e need to restore the faith and the trust of the American people in their own government  In addition to that  we\\'ve suffered because we haven\\'t had leadership in this administration  w e\\'ve got a government of stalemate  w e\\'ve lost the vision of what our country can and ought to be  This is not the America that we\\'ve known in the past  It\\'s not the America that we have to have in the future  I don\\'t claim to know all the answers  But I\\'ve got confidence in my country  Our economic strength is still there  Our system of government   in spite of Vietnam  Cambodia  CIA  w atergate   is still the best system of government on earth  And the greatest resource of all are the two hundred and fifteen million Americans who have within us the strength  the character  the intelligence  the experience  the patriotism  the idealism  the compassion  the sense of brotherhood on which we can rely in the future to restore the greatness to our country w e ought not to be excluded from our government anymore  w e need a president who can go in   who derives his strength from the people  I owe the special interests nothing  I owe everything to you  the people of this country  And I believe that we can bind our wounds  I believe that we can work together  And I believe that if we can tap the tremendous untapped reservoir of innate strength in this country  that we can once again have a government as good as our people  and let the world know what we still know and hope for   that we still live in the greatest and the strongest and the best country on earth MR  NEw MAN: President Ford MR  FORD: On November second all of you will make a very  very important decision  One of the major issues in this campaign is trust  A president should never promise more than he can deliver and a president should always deliver everything that he\\'s promised  A president can\\'t be all things to all people  A president should be the same thing to all people  Another issue in this campaign  Governor Carter has endorsed the Democratic platform  which calls for more spending  bigger deficits  more inflation or mare taxes  Governor Carter has embraced the record of the present Congress  dominated by his political party  It calls for more of the same  Governor Carter in his acceptance speech called for more and more programs  which means more and more government  I think the real issue in this campaign  and that which you must decide on November second  is whether you should vote for his promise or my performance in two years in the w hite House  On the fourth of July we had a wonderful two hundredth birthday   for our great country  It was a superb occasion  It was a glorious day  In the first century of our nation\\'s history our forefathers gave us the finest form of government in the history of mankind  In the second century of our nation\\'s history  our forefathers developed the most productive industrial nation in the history of the globe  Our third century should be the century of individual freedom for all our two hundred and fifteen million Americans today and all that join us  In the last few years government has gotten bigger and bigger; industry has gotten larger and larger; labor unions have gotten bigger and bigger; and our children have been the victims of mass education  w e must make this next century the century of the individual  w e should never forget that a government big enough to give us everything we want is a government big enough to take from us everything we have  The individual worker in the plants throughout the United States should not be a small cog in a big machine  The member of a labor union must have his rights strengthened and broadened and our children in their education should have an opportunity to improve themselves based on their talents and their abilities  My mother and father  during the Depression  worked very hard to give me an opportunity to do better in our great country  Your mothers and fathers did the same thing for you and others  Betty and I have worked very hard to give our children a brighter future in the United States  our beloved country  You and others in this great country have worked hard and done a great deal to give your children and your grandchildren the blessings of a better America  I believe we can all work together to make the individuals in the future have more and all of us working together can build a better America MR  NEw MAN: Thank you President Ford  Thank you Governor Carter  Our thanks also to the questioners and to the audience in this theater  Ahh   we much regret the technical failure that caused a twenty eight minute delay in the broadcast of the debate  w e believe  however  that everyone will agree that it did not detract from the effectiveness of the debate or from its fairness  The next presidential debate is to take place on w ednesday  October sixth  in San Francisco at nine thirty P  M   Eastern Daylight Time  The topics are to be foreign and defense issues  As with all three debates between the presidential candidates and the one between the vice presidential candidates  it is being arranged by the League of w omen Voters Education Fund in the hope of promoting a wider and better informed participation by the American people in the election in November  Now  from the w alnut Street Theater in Philadelphia  good night ',\n",
       " 'September 26  1960 Debate TranscriptSeptember 26  1960The First Kennedy Nixon Presidential DebateHOw ARD K  SMITH  MODERATOR: Good evening  The television and radio stations of the United States and their affiliated stations are proud to provide facilities for a discussion of issues in the current political campaign by the two major candidates for the presidency  The candidates need no introduction  The Republican candidate  Vice President Richard M  Nixon  and the Democratic candidate  Senator John F  Kennedy  According to rules set by the candidates themselves  each man shall make an opening statement of approximately eight minutes\\' duration and a closing statement of approximately three minutes\\' duration  In between the candidates will answer  or comment upon answers to questions put by a panel of correspondents  In this  the first discussion in a series of four uh   joint appearances  the subject matter has been agreed  will be restricted to internal or domestic American matters  And now for the first opening statement by Senator John F  Kennedy SENATOR KENNEDY: Mr  Smith  Mr  Nixon  In the election of 1860  Abraham Lincoln said the question was whether this nation could exist half slave or half free  In the election of 1960  and with the world around us  the question is whether the world will exist half slave or half free  whether it will move in the direction of freedom  in the direction of the road that we are taking  or whether it will move in the direction of slavery  I think it will depend in great measure upon what we do here in the United States  on the kind of society that we build  on the kind of strength that we maintain  w e discuss tonight domestic issues  but I would not want that to be any implication to be given that this does not involve directly our struggle with Mr  Khrushchev for survival  Mr  Khrushchev is in New York  and he maintains the Communist offensive throughout the world because of the productive power of the Soviet Union itself  The Chinese Communists have always had a large population  But they are important and dangerous now because they are mounting a major effort within their own country  The kind of country we have here  the kind of society we have  the kind of strength we build in the United States will be the defense of freedom  If we do well here  if we meet our obligations  if we\\'re moving ahead  then I think freedom will be secure around the world  If we fail  then freedom fails  Therefore  I think the question before the American people is: Are we doing as much as we can do  Are we as strong as we should be  Are we as strong as we must be if we\\'re going to maintain our independence  and if we\\'re going to maintain and hold out the hand of friendship to those who look to us for assistance  to those who look to us for survival  I should make it very clear that I do not think we\\'re doing enough  that I am not satisfied as an American with the progress that we\\'re making  This is a great country  but I think it could be a greater country; and this is a powerful country  but I think it could be a more powerful country  I\\'m not satisfied to have fifty percent of our steel mill capacity unused  I\\'m not satisfied when the United States had last year the lowest rate of economic growth of any major industrialized society in the world  Because economic growth means strength and vitality; it means we\\'re able to sustain our defenses; it means we\\'re able to meet our commitments abroad  I\\'m not satisfied when we have over nine billion dollars worth of food   some of it rotting   even though there is a hungry world  and even though four million Americans wait every month for a food package from the government  which averages five cents a day per individual  I saw cases in w est Virginia  here in the United States  where children took home part of their school lunch in order to feed their families because I don\\'t think we\\'re meeting our obligations toward these Americans  I\\'m not satisfied when the Soviet Union is turning out twice as many scientists and engineers as we are  I\\'m not satisfied when many of our teachers are inadequately paid  or when our children go to school part time shifts  I think we should have an educational system second to none  I\\'m not satisfied when I see men like Jimmy Hoffa   in charge of the largest union in the United States   still free  I\\'m not satisfied when we are failing to develop the natural resources of the United States to the fullest  Here in the United States  which developed the Tennessee Valley and which built the Grand Coulee and the other dams in the Northwest United States at the present rate of hydropower production   and that is the hallmark of an industrialized society   the Soviet Union by 1975 will be producing more power than we are  These are all the things  I think  in this country that can make our society strong  or can mean that it stands still  I\\'m not satisfied until every American enjoys his full constitutional rights  If a Negro baby is born   and this is true also of Puerto Ricans and Mexicans in some of our cities   he has about one half as much chance to get through high school as a white baby  He has one third as much chance to get through college as a white student  He has about a third as much chance to be a professional man  about half as much chance to own a house  He has about uh   four times as much chance that he\\'ll be out of work in his life as the white baby  I think we can do better  I don\\'t want the talents of any American to go to waste  I know that there are those who want to turn everything over to the government  I don\\'t at all  I want the individuals to meet their responsibilities  And I want the states to meet their responsibilities  But I think there is also a national responsibility  The argument has been used against every piece of social legislation in the last twenty five years  The people of the United States individually could not have developed the Tennessee Valley; collectively they could have  A cotton farmer in Georgia or a peanut farmer or a dairy farmer in w isconsin and Minnesota  he cannot protect himself against the forces of supply and demand in the market place; but working together in effective governmental programs he can do so  Seventeen million Americans  who live over sixty five on an average Social Security check of about seventy eight dollars a month  they\\'re not able to sustain themselves individually  but they can sustain themselves through the social security system  I don\\'t believe in big government  but I believe in effective governmental action  And I think that\\'s the only way that the United States is going to maintain its freedom  It\\'s the only way that we\\'re going to move ahead  I think we can do a better job  I think we\\'re going to have to do a better job if we are going to meet the responsibilities which time and events have placed upon us  w e cannot turn the job over to anyone else  If the United States fails  then the whole cause of freedom fails  And I think it depends in great measure on what we do here in this country  The reason Franklin Roosevelt was a good neighbor in Latin America was because he was a good neighbor in the United States  Because they felt that the American society was moving again  I want us to recapture that image  I want people in Latin America and Africa and Asia to start to look to America; to see how we\\'re doing things; to wonder what the resident of the United States is doing; and not to look at Khrushchev  or look at the Chinese Communists  That is the obligation upon our generation  In 1933  Franklin Roosevelt said in his inaugural that this generation of Americans has a rendezvous with destiny  I think our generation of Americans has the same rendezvous  The question now is: Can freedom be maintained under the most severe tack   attack it has ever known  I think it can be  And I think in the final analysis it depends upon what we do here  I think it\\'s time America started moving again MR  SMITH: And now the opening statement by Vice President Richard M  Nixon MR  NIXON: Mr  Smith  Senator Kennedy  The things that Senator Kennedy has said many of us can agree with  There is no question but that we cannot discuss our internal affairs in the United States without recognizing that they have a tremendous bearing on our international position  There is no question but that this nation cannot stand still; because we are in a deadly competition  a competition not only with the men in the Kremlin  but the men in Peking  w e\\'re ahead in this competition  as Senator Kennedy  I think  has implied  But when you\\'re in a race  the only way to stay ahead is to move ahead  And I subscribe completely to the spirit that Senator Kennedy has expressed tonight  the spirit that the United States should move ahead  w here  then  do we disagree  I think we disagree on the implication of his remarks tonight and on the statements that he has made on many occasions during his campaign to the effect that the United States has been standing still  w e heard tonight  for example  the statement made that our growth in national product last year was the lowest of any industrial nation in the world  Now last year  of course  was 1958  That happened to be a recession year  But when we look at the growth of G N P  this year  a year of recovery  we find that it\\'s six and nine tenths per cent and one of the highest in the world today  More about that later  Looking then to this problem of how the United States should move ahead and where the United States is moving  I think it is well that we take the advice of a very famous campaigner: Let\\'s look at the record  Is the United States standing still  Is it true that this Administration  as Senator Kennedy has charged  has been an Administration of retreat  of defeat  of stagnation  Is it true that  as far as this country is concerned  in the field of electric power  in all of the fields that he has mentioned  we have not been moving ahead  w ell  we have a comparison that we can make  w e have the record of the Truman Administration of seven and a half years and the seven and a half years of the Eisenhower Administration  w hen we compare these two records in the areas that Senator Kennedy has   has discussed tonight  I think we find that America has been moving ahead  Let\\'s take schools  w e have built more schools in these last seven and a half years than we built in the previous seven and a half  for that matter in the previous twenty years  Let\\'s take hydroelectric power  w e have developed more hydroelectric power in these seven and a half years than was developed in any previous administration in history  Let us take hospitals  w e find that more have been built in this Administration than in the previous Administration  The same is true of highways  Let\\'s put it in terms that all of us can understand  w e often hear gross national product discussed and in that respect may I say that when we compare the growth in this Administration with that of the previous Administration that then there was a total growth of eleven percent over seven years; in this Administration there has been a total growth of nineteen per cent over seven years  That shows that there\\'s been more growth in this Administration than in its predecessor  But let\\'s not put it there; let\\'s put it in terms of the average family  w hat has happened to you  w e find that your wages have gone up five times as much in the Eisenhower Administration as they did in the Truman Administration  w hat about the prices you pay  w e find that the prices you pay went up five times as much in the Truman Administration as they did in the Eisenhower Administration  w hat\\'s the net result of this  This means that the average family income went up fifteen per cent in the Eisenhower years as against two per cent in the Truman years  Now  this is not standing still  But  good as this record is  may I emphasize it isn\\'t enough  A record is never something to stand on  It\\'s something to build on  And in building on this record  I believe that we have the secret for progress  we know the way to progress  And I think  first of all  our own record proves that we know the way  Senator Kennedy has suggested that he believes he knows the way  I respect the sincerity which he m  which he makes that suggestion  But on the other hand  when we look at the various programs that he offers  they do not seem to be new  They seem to be simply retreads of the programs of the Truman Administration which preceded it  And I would suggest that during the course of the evening he might indicate those areas in which his programs are new  where they will mean more progress than we had then  w hat kind of programs are we for  w e are for programs that will expand educational opportunities  that will give to all Americans their equal chance for education  for all of the things which are necessary and dear to the hearts of our people  w e are for programs  in addition  which will see that our medical care for the aged are   is   are much   is much better handled than it is at the present time  Here again  may I indicate that Senator Kennedy and I are not in disagreement as to the aims  w e both want to help the old people  w e want to see that they do have adequate medical care  The question is the means  I think that the means that I advocate will reach that goal better than the means that he advocates  I could give better examples  but for   for whatever it is  whether it\\'s in the field of housing  or health  or medical care  or schools  or the eh  development of electric power  we have programs which we believe will move America  move her forward and build on the wonderful record that we have made over these past seven and a half years  Now  when we look at these programs  might I suggest that in evaluating them we often have a tendency to say that the test of a program is how much you\\'re spending  I will concede that in all the areas to which I have referred Senator Kennedy would have the spe  federal government spend more than I would have it spend  I costed out the cost of the Democratic platform  It runs a minimum of thirteen and two tenths billions dollars a year more than we are presently spending to a maximum of eighteen billion dollars a year more than we\\'re presently spending  Now the Republican platform will cost more too  It will cost a minimum of four billion dollars a year more  a maximum of four and nine tenths billion dollar a year more than we\\'re presently spending  Now  does this mean that his program is better than ours  Not at all  Because it isn\\'t a question of how much the federal government spends; it isn\\'t a question of which government does the most  It is a question of which administration does the right thing  And in our case  I do believe that our programs will stimulate the creative energies of a hundred and eighty million free Americans  I believe the programs that Senator Kennedy advocates will have a tendency to stifle those creative energies  I believe in other words  that his program would lead to the stagnation of the motive power that we need in this country to get progress  The final point that I would like to make is this: Senator Kennedy has suggested in his speeches that we lack compassion for the poor  for the old  and for others that are unfortunate  Let us understand throughout this campaign that his motives and mine are sincere  I know what it means to be poor  I know what it means to see people who are unemployed  I know Senator Kennedy feels as deeply about these problems as I do  but our disagreement is not about the goals for America but only about the means to reach those goals MR  SMITH: Thank you  Mr  Nixon  That completes the opening statements  and now the candidates will answer questions or comment upon one another\\'s answers to questions  put by correspondents of the networks  The correspondents: [introducing themselves: \"I\\'m Sander Vanocur  NBC News;\" \"I\\'m Charles w arren  Mutual News;\" \"I\\'m Stuart Novins  CBS News;\" \"Bob Fleming  ABC News \"] The first question to Senator Kennedy from Mr  Fleming MR  FLEMING: Senator  the Vice President in his campaign has said that you were naive and at times immature  He has raised the question of leadership  On this issue  why do you think people should vote for you rather than the Vice President MR  KENNEDY: w ell  the Vice President and I came to the Congress together 1946; we both served in the Labor Committee  I\\'ve been there now for fourteen years  the same period of time that he has  so that our experience in uh   government is comparable  Secondly  I think the question is uh   what are the programs that we advocate  what is the party record that we lead  I come out of the Democratic party  which in this century has produced w oodrow w ilson and Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman  and which supported and sustained these programs which I\\'ve discussed tonight  Mr  Nixon comes out of the Republican party  He was nominated by it  And it is a fact that through most of these last twenty five years the Republican leadership has opposed federal aid for education  medical care for the aged  development of the Tennessee Valley  development of our natural resources  I think Mr  Nixon is an effective leader of his party  I hope he would grant me the same  The question before us is: which point of view and which party do we want to lead the United States MR  SMITH: Mr  Nixon  would you like to comment on that statement Mr  NIXON: I have no comment Mr  SMITH: The next question: Mr  Novins MR  NOVINS: Mr  Vice President  your campaign stresses the value of your eight year experience  and the question arises as to whether that experience was as an observer or as a participant or as an initiator of policy making  w ould you tell us please specifically what major proposals you have made in the last eight years that have been adopted by the Administration MR  NIXON: It would be rather difficult to cover them in eight and  in two and a half minutes  I would suggest that these proposals could be mentioned  First  after each of my foreign trips I have made recommendations that have been adopted  For example  after my first trip abroad   abroad  I strongly recommended that we increase our exchange programs particularly as they related to exchange of persons of leaders in the labor field and in the information field  After my trip to South America  I made recommendations that a separate inter American lending agency be set up which the South American nations would like much better than a lend  than to participate in the lending agencies which treated all the countries of the world the same  Uh   I have made other recommendations after each of the other trips; for example  after my trip abroad to Hungary I made some recommendations with regard to the Hungarian refugee situation which were adopted  not only by the President but some of them were enacted into law by the Congress  w ithin the Administration  as a chairman of the President\\'s Committee on Price Stability and Economic Growth  I have had the opportunity to make recommendations which have been adopted within the Administration and which I think have been reasonably effective  I know Senator Kennedy suggested in his speech at Cleveland yesterday that that committee had not been particularly effective  I would only suggest that while we do not take the credit for it   I would not presume to   that since that committee has been formed the price line has been held very well within the United States MR  KENNEDY: w ell  I would say in the latter that the   and that\\'s what I found uh   somewhat unsatisfactory about the figures uh   Mr  Nixon  that you used in your previous speech  when you talked about the Truman Administration  You   Mr  Truman came to office in nineteen uh   forty four and at the end of the war  and uh   difficulties that were facing the United States during that period of transition   1946 when price controls were lifted   so it\\'s rather difficult to use an overall figure taking those seven and a half years and comparing them to the last eight years  I prefer to take the overall percentage record of the last twenty years of the Democrats and the eight years of the Republicans to show an overall period of growth  In regard to uh   price stability uh   I\\'m not aware that that committee did produce recommendations that ever were certainly before the Congress from the point of view of legislation in regard to controlling prices  In regard to the exchange of students and labor unions  I am chairman of the subcommittee on Africa and I think that one of the most unfortunate phases of our policy towards that country was the very minute number of exchanges that we had  I think it\\'s true of Latin America also  w e did come forward with a program of students for the Congo of over three hundred which was more than the federal government had for all of Africa the previous year  so that I don\\'t think that uh   we have moved at least in those two areas with sufficient vigor MR  SMITH: The next question to Senator Kennedy from Mr  w arren MR  w ARREN: Uh   Senator Kennedy  during your brief speech a few minutes ago you mentioned farm surpluses MR  KENNEDY: That\\'s correct MR  w ARREN: I\\'d like to ask this: It\\'s a fact  I think  that presidential candidates traditionally make promises to farmers  Lots of people  I think  don\\'t understand why the government pays farmers for not producing certain crops or paying farmers if they overproduce for that matter  Now  let me ask  sir  why can\\'t the farmer operate like the business man who operates a factory  If an auto company overproduces a certain model car Uncle Sam doesn\\'t step in and buy up the surplus  w hy this constant courting of the farmer MR  KENNEDY: w ell  because I think that if the federal government moved out of the program and withdrew its supports uh   then I think you would have complete uh   economic chaos  The farmer plants in the spring and harvests in the fall  There are hundreds of thousands of them  They really don\\'t   they\\'re not able to control their market very well  They bring their crops in or their livestock in  many of them about the same time  They have only a few purchasers that buy their milk or their hogs   a few large companies in many cases   and therefore the farmer is not in a position to bargain very effectively in the market place  I think the experience of the twenties has shown what a free market could do to agriculture  And if the agricultural economy collapses  then the economy of the rest of the United States sooner or later will collapse  The farmers are the number one market for the automobile industry of the United States  The automobile industry is the number one market for steel  So if the farmers\\' economy continues to decline as sharply as it has in recent years  then I think you would have a recession in the rest of the country  So I think the case for the government intervention is a good one  Secondly  my objection to present farm policy is that there are no effective controls to bring supply and demand into better balance  The dropping of the support price in order to limit production does not work  and we now have the highest uh   surpluses   nine billion dollars worth  w e\\'ve had a uh   higher tax load from the Treasury for the farmer in the last few years with the lowest farm income in many years  I think that this farm policy has failed  In my judgment the only policy that will work will be for effective supply and demand to be in balance  And that can only be done through governmental action  I therefore suggest that in those basic commodities which are supported  that the federal government  after endorsement by the farmers in that commodity  attempt to bring supply and demand into balance   attempt effective production controls   so that we won\\'t have that five or six per cent surplus which breaks the price fifteen or twenty per cent  I think Mr  Benson\\'s program has failed  And I must say  after reading the Vice President\\'s speech before the farmers  as he read mine  I don\\'t believe that it\\'s very much different from Mr  Benson\\'s  I don\\'t think it provides effective governmental controls  I think the support prices are tied to the average market price of the last three years  which was Mr  Benson\\'s theory  I therefore do not believe that this is a sharp enough breach with the past to give us any hope of success for the future MR  SMITH: Mr  Nixon  comment MR  NIXON; I of course disagree with Senator Kennedy insofar as his suggestions as to what should be done uh   with re  on the farm program  He has made the suggestion that what we need is to move in the direction of more government controls  a suggestion that would also mean raising prices uh   that the consumers pay for products and im  and imposing upon the farmers uh   controls on acreage even far more than they have today  I think this is the wrong direction  I don\\'t think this has worked in the past; I do not think it will work in the future  The program that I have advocated is one which departs from the present program that we have in this respect  It recognizes that the government has a responsibility to get the farmer out of the trouble he presently is in because the government got him into it  And that\\'s the fundamental reason why we can\\'t let the farmer go by himself at the present time  The farmer produced these surpluses because the government asked him to through legislation during the war  Now that we have these surpluses  it\\'s our responsibility to indemnify the farmer during that period that we get rid of the farmer uh   the surpluses  Until we get the surpluses off the farmer\\'s back  however  we should have a program such as I announced  which will see that farm income holds up  But I would propose holding that income up not through a type of program that Senator Kennedy has suggested that would raise prices  but one that would indemnify the farmer  pay the farmer in kind uh   from the products which are in surplus Mr  SMITH: The next question to Vice President Nixon from Mr  Vanocur MR  VANOCUR: Uh   Mr  Vice President  since the question of executive leadership is a very important campaign issue  I\\'d like to follow Mr  Novins\\' question  Now  Republican campaign slogans   you\\'ll see them on signs around the country as you did last week   say it\\'s experience that counts   that\\'s over a picture of yourself; sir uh   implying that you\\'ve had more governmental executive decision making uh   experience than uh   your opponent  Now  in his news conference on August twenty fourth  President Eisenhower was asked to give one example of a major idea of yours that he adopted  His reply was  and I\\'m quoting; \"If you give me a week I might think of one  I don\\'t remember \" Now that was a month ago  sir  and the President hasn\\'t brought it up since  and I\\'m wondering  sir  if you can clarify which version is correct   the one put out by Republican campaign leaders or the one put out by President Eisenhower MR  NIXON: w ell  I would suggest  Mr  Vanocur  that uh   if you know the President  that was probably a facetious remark  Uh   I would also suggest that insofar as his statement is concerned  that I think it would be improper for the President of the United States to disclose uh   the instances in which members of his official family had made recommendations  as I have made them through the years to him  which he has accepted or rejected  The President has always maintained and very properly so that he is entitled to get what advice he wants from his cabinet and from his other advisers without disclosing that to anybody   including as a matter of fact the Congress  Now  I can only say this  Through the years I have sat in the National Security Council  I have been in the cabinet  I have met with the legislative leaders  I have met with the President when he made the great decisions with regard to Lebanon  Quemoy and Matsu  other matters  The President has asked for my advice  I have given it  Sometimes my advice has been taken  Sometimes it has not  I do not say that I have made the decisions  And I would say that no president should ever allow anybody else to make the major decisions  The president only makes the decisions  All that his advisers do is to give counsel when he asks for it  As far as what experience counts and whether that is experience that counts  that isn\\'t for me to say  Uh   I can only say that my experience is there for the people to consider; Senator Kennedy\\'s is there for the people to consider  As he pointed out  we came to the Congress in the same year  His experience has been different from mine  Mine has been in the executive branch  His has been in the legislative branch  I would say that the people now have the opportunity to evaluate his as against mine and I think both he and I are going to abide by whatever the people decide MR  SMITH: Senator Kennedy Mr  KENNEDY: w ell  I\\'ll just say that the question is of experience and the question also is uh   what our judgment is of the future  and what our goals are for the United States  and what ability we have to implement those goals  Abraham Lincoln came to the presidency in 1860 after a rather little known uh   session in the House of Representatives and after being defeated for the Senate in fifty eight and was a distinguished president  There\\'s no certain road to the presidency  There are no guarantees that uh   if you take uh   one road or another that you will be a successful president  I have been in the Congress for fourteen years  I have voted in the last uh   eight years uh   and the Vice President was uh   presiding over the Senate and meeting his other responsibilities  I have met met uh   decisions over eight hundred times on matters which affect not only the domestic security of the United States  but as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee  The question really is: which candidate and which party can meet the problems that the United States is going to face in the sixties MR  SMITH: The next question to Senator Kennedy from Mr  Novins MR  NOVINS: Senator Kennedy  in connection with these problems of the future that you speak of  and the program that you enunciated earlier in your direct talk  you call for expanding some of the welfare programs for schools  for teacher salaries  medical care  and so forth; but you also call for reducing the federal debt  And I\\'m wondering how you  if you\\'re president in January  would go about paying the bill for all this  Does this mean that you MR  KENNEDY: I didn\\'t indicate  I did not advocate reducing the federal debt because I don\\'t believe that you\\'re going to be able to reduce the federal debt very much in nineteen sixty one  two  or three  I think you have heavy obligations which affect our security  which we\\'re going to have to meet  And therefore I\\'ve never suggested we should uh   be able to retire the debt substantially  or even at all in nineteen sixty one or two MR  NOVINS: Senator  I believe in   in one of your speeches  MR  KENNEDY: No  never MR  NOVINS:   you suggested that reducing the interest rate would help toward  MR  KENNEDY: No  No  Not reducing the interest  MR  NOVINS:   a reduction of the Federal debt MR  KENNEDY:   reducing the interest rate  In my judgment  the hard money  tight money policy  fiscal policy of this Administration has contributed to the slow down in our economy  which helped bring the recession of fifty four; which made the recession of fifty eight rather intense  and which has slowed  somewhat  our economic activity in 1960  w hat I have talked about  however  the kind of programs that I\\'ve talked about  in my judgment  are uh   fiscally sound  Medical care for the aged  I would put under social security  The Vice President and I disagree on this  The program   the Javits Nixon or the Nixon Javits program   would have cost  if fully used uh   six hundred million dollars by the government per year  and six hundred million dollars by the state  The program which I advocated  which failed by five votes in the United States Senate  would have put medical care for the aged in Social Security  and would have been paid for through the Social Security System and the Social Security tax  Secondly  I support federal aid to education and federal aid for teachers\\' salaries  I think that\\'s a good investment  I think we\\'re going to have to do it  And I think to heap the burden further on the property tax  which is already strained in many of our communities  will provide  will make sh  insure  in my opinion  that many of our children will not be adequately educated  and many of our teachers not adequately compensated  There is no greater return to an economy or to a society than an educational system second to none  On the question of the development of natural resources  I would pay as you go in the sense that they would be balanced and the power revenues would bring back sufficient money to finance the projects  in the same way as the Tennessee Valley  I believe in the balanced budget  And the only conditions under which I would unbalance the budget would be if there was a grave national emergency or a serious recession  Otherwise  with a steady rate of economic growth   and Mr  Nixon and Mr  Rockefeller  in their meeting  said a five per cent economic growth would bring by 1962 ten billion dollars extra in tax revenues  w hatever is brought in  I think that we can finance essential programs within a balanced budget  if business remains orderly MR  SMITH: Mr  Nixon  your comment MR  NIXON: Yes  I think what Mr  Novins was referring to was not one of Senator Kennedy\\'s speeches  but the Democratic platform  which did mention cutting the national debt  I think  too  that it should be pointed out that of course it is not possible  particularly under the proposals that Senator Kennedy has advocated  either to cut the national debt or to reduce taxes  As a matter of fact it will be necessary to raise taxes  As Senator Kennedy points out that as far as his one proposal is concerned   the one for medical care for the aged   that that would be financed out of Social Security  That  however  is raising taxes for those who pay Social Security  He points out that he would make pay as you go be the basis for our natural resources development  w here our natural resources development   which I also support  incidentally  however   whenever you uh   uh   in   in   uh   appropriates money for one of these projects  you have to pay now and appropriate the money and the eh  while they eventually do pay out  it doesn\\'t mean that you   the government doesn\\'t have to put out the money this year  And so I would say that in all of these proposals Senator Kennedy has made  they will result in one of two things: either he has to raise taxes or he has to unbalance the budget  If he unbalances the budget  that means you have inflation  and that will be  of course  a very cruel blow to the very people   the older people   that we\\'ve been talking about  As far as aid for school construction is concerned  I favor that  as Senator Kennedy did  in January of this year  when he said he favored that rather than aid to s  teacher salaries  I favor that because I believe that\\'s the best way to aid our schools without running any risk whatever of the federal government telling our teachers what to teach MR  SMITH: The next question to Vice President Nixon from Mr  w arren MR  w ARREN: Mr  Vice President you mentioned schools and it was just yesterday I think you asked for a crash program to raise education standards  and this evening you talked about advances in education  Mr  Vice President  you said   it was back in 1957   that salaries paid to school teachers were nothing short of a national disgrace  Higher salaries for teachers  you added  were important and if the situation wasn\\'t corrected it could lead to a national disaster  And yet  you refused to vote in the Senate in order to break a tie vote when that single vote  if it had been yes  would have granted salary increases to teachers  I wonder if you could explain that  sir MR  NIXON: I\\'m awfully glad you ge  got that question because as you know I got into it at the last of my other question and wasn\\'t able to complete the argument  Uh   I think that the reason that I voted against having the federal government uh   pay teachers\\' salaries was probably the very reason that concerned Senator Kennedy when in January of this year  in his kick off press conference  he said that he favored aid for school construction  but at that time did not feel that there should be aid for teachers\\' salaries   at least that\\'s the way I read his remarks  Now  why should there be any question about the federal government aiding s  teachers\\' salaries  w hy did Senator Kennedy take that position then  w hy do I take it now  w e both took it then  and I take it now  for this reason: we want higher teachers\\' salaries  w e need higher teachers\\' salaries  But we also want our education to be free of federal control  w hen the federal government gets the power to pay teachers  inevitably in my opinion  it will acquire the power to set standards and to tell the teachers what to teach  I think this would be bad for the country; I think it would be bad for the teaching profession  There is another point that should be made  I favor higher salaries for teachers  But  as Senator Kennedy said in January of this year in this same press conference  the way that you get higher salaries for teachers is to support school construction  which means that all of the local school districts in the various states then have money which is freed to raise the standards for teachers\\' salaries  I should also point out this; once you put the responsibility on the federal government for paying a portion of teachers\\' salaries  your local communities and your states are not going to meet the responsibility as much as they should  I believe  in other words  that we have seen the local communities and the state assuming more of that responsibility  Teachers\\' salaries very fortunately have gone up fifty percent in the last eight years as against only a thirty four percent rise for other salaries  This is not enough; it should be more  But I do not believe that the way to get more salaries for teachers is to have the federal government get in with a massive program  My objection here is not the cost in dollars  My objection here is the potential cost in controls and eventual freedom for the American people by giving the federal government power over education  and that is the greatest power a government can have MR  SMITH: Senator Kennedy\\'s comment MR  KENNEDY: w hen uh   the Vice President quotes me in January  sixty  I do not believe the federal government should pay directly teachers\\' salaries  but that was not the issue before the Senate in February  The issue before the Senate was that the money would be given to the state  The state then could determine whether the money would be spent for school construction or teacher salaries  On that question the Vice President and I disagreed  I voted in favor of that proposal and supported it strongly  because I think that that provided assistance to our teachers for their salaries without any chance of federal control and it is on that vote that th  Mr  Nixon and I disagreed  and his tie vote uh   defeated his breaking the tie defeated the proposal  I don\\'t want the federal government paying teachers\\' salaries directly  But if the money will go to the states and the states can then determine whether it shall go for school construction or for teachers\\' salaries  in my opinion you protect the local authority over the school board and the school committee  And therefore I think that was a sound proposal and that is why I supported it and I regret that it did not pass  Secondly  there have been statements made that uh   the Democratic platform would cost a good deal of money and that I am in favor of unbalancing the budget  That is wholly wrong  wholly in error  and it is a fact that in the last eight years the Democratic Congress has reduced the appropri  the requests for the appropriations by over ten billion dollars  That is not my view and I think it ought to be stated very clearly on the record  My view is that you can do these programs   and they should be carefully drawn   within a balanced budget if our economy is moving ahead MR  SMITH: The next question to Senator Kennedy from Mr  Vanocur MR  VANOCUR: Senator  you\\'ve been promising the voters that if you are elected president you\\'ll try and push through Congress bills on medical aid to the aged  a comprehensive minimum hourly wage bill  federal aid to education  Now  in the August post convention session of the Congress  when you at least held up the possibility you could one day be president and when you had overwhelming majorities  especially in the Senate  you could not get action on these bills  Now how do you feel that you\\'ll be able to get them in January  MR  KENNEDY: w ell as you take the bills  MR  VANOCUR:   if you weren\\'t able to get them in August MR  KENNEDY: If I may take the bills  we did pass in the Senate a bill uh   to provide a dollar twenty five cent minimum wage  It failed because the House did not pass it and the House failed by eleven votes  And I might say that two thirds of the Republicans in the House voted against a dollar twenty five cent minimum wage and a majority of the Democrats sustained it   nearly two thirds of them voted for the dollar twenty five  w e were threatened by a veto if we passed a dollar and a quarter   it\\'s extremely difficult with the great power that the president does to pass any bill when the president is opposed to it  All the president needs to sustain his veto of any bill is one third plus one in either the House or the Senate  Secondly  we passed a federal aid to education bill in the Senate  It failed to came to the floor of the House of Representatives  It was killed in the Rules Committee  And it is a fact in the August session that the four members of the Rules Committee who were Republicans joining with two Democrats voted against sending the aid to education bill to the floor of the House  Four Democrats voted for it  Every Republican on the Rules Committee voted against sending that bill to be considered by the members of the House of Representatives  Thirdly  on medical care for the aged  this is the same fight that\\'s been going on for twenty five years in Social Security  w e wanted to tie it to Social Security  w e offered an amendment to do so  Forty four Democrats voted for it  one Republican voted for it  And we were informed at the time it came to a vote that if it was adopted the President of the United States would veto it  In my judgment  a vigorous Democratic president supported by a Democratic majority in the House and Senate can win the support for these programs  But if you send a Republican president and a Democratic majority and the threat of a veto hangs over the Congress  in my judgment you will continue what happened in the August session  which is a clash of parties and inaction MR  SMITH: Mr  Nixon  comment MR  NIXON: w ell obviously my views are a little different  First of all  I don\\'t see how it\\'s possible for a one third of a body  such as the Republicans have in the House and the Senate to stop two thirds  if the two thirds are adequately led  I would say  too  that when Senator Kennedy refers to the action of the House Rules Committee  there are eight Democrats on that committee and four Republicans  It would seem to me again that it is very difficult to blame the four Republicans for the eight Democrats\\' not getting a something through that particular committee  I would say further that to blame the President in his veto power for the inability of the Senator and his colleagues to get action in this special session uh   misses the mark  w hen the president exercises his veto power  he has to have the people upo  behind him  not just a third of the Congress  Because let\\'s consider it  If the majority of the members of the Congress felt that these particular proposals were good issues   the majority of those who were Democrats   why didn\\'t they pass them and send to the President and get a veto and have an issue  The reason why these particular bills in these various fields that have been mentioned were not passed was not because the President was against them; it was because the people were against them  It was because they were too extreme  And I am convinced that the alternate proposals that I have  that the Republicans have in the field of health  in the field of education  in the field of welfare  because they are not extreme  because they will accomplish the end uh   without too great cost in dollars or in freedom  that they could get through the next Congress MR  SMITH: The next question to Vice President Nixon fa  from Mr  Fleming MR  FLEMING: Mr  Vice President  do I take it then you believe that you can work better with Democratic majorities in the House and Senate than Senator Kennedy could work with Democratic majorities in the House and Senate MR  NIXON; I would say this: that we  of course  expect to pick up some seats in both in the House and the Senate  Uh   w e would hope to control the House  to get a majority in the House uh   in this election  w e cannot  of course  control the Senate  I would say that a president will be able to lead   a president will be able to get his program through   to the effect that he has the support of the country  the support of the people  Sometimes we   we get the opinion that in getting programs through the House or the Senate it\\'s purely a question of legislative finagling and all that sort of thing  It isn\\'t really that  w henever a majority of the people are for a program  the House and the Senate responds to it  And whether this House and Senate  in the next session is Democratic or Republican  if the country will have voted for the candidate for the presidency and for the proposals that he has made  I believe that you will find that the president  if it were a Republican  as it would be in my case  would be able to get his program through that Congress  Now  I also say that as far as Senator Kennedy\\'s proposals are concerned  that  again  the question is not simply one of uh   a presidential veto stopping programs  You must always remember that a president can\\'t stop anything unless he has the people behind him  And the reason President Eisenhower\\'s vetoes have been sustained   the reason the Congress does not send up bills to him which they think will be vetoed   is because the people and the Congress  the majority of them  know the country is behind the President MR  SMITH: Senator Kennedy MR  KENNEDY: w ell  now let\\'s look at these bills that the Vice President suggests were too extreme  One was a bill for a dollar twenty five cents an hour for anyone who works in a store or company that has a million dollars a year business  I don\\'t think that\\'s extreme at all; and yet nearly two thirds to three fourths of the Republicans in the House of Representatives voted against that proposal  Secondly was the federal aid to education bill  It   it was a very uh   because of the defeat of teacher salaries  it was not a bill that uh   met in my opinion the need  The fact of the matter is it was a bill that was less than you recommended  Mr  Nixon  this morning in your proposal  It was not an extreme bill and yet we could not get one Republican to join  at least I think four of the eight Democrats voted to send it to the floor of the House   not one Republican   and they joined with those Democrats who were opposed to it  I don\\'t say the Democrats are united in their support of the program  But I do say a majority are  And I say a majority of the Republicans are opposed to it  The third is medical care for the aged which is tied to Social Security  which is financed out of Social Security funds  It does not put a deficit on the Treasury  The proposal advanced by you and by Mr  Javits would have cost six hundred millions of dollars   Mr  Rockefeller rejected it in New York  said he didn\\'t agree with the financing at all  said it ought to be on Social Security  So these are three programs which are quite moderate  I think it shows the difference between the two parties  One party is ready to move in these programs  The other party gives them lip service MR  SMITH: Mr  w arren\\'s question for Senator Kennedy MR  w ARREN: Senator Kennedy  on another subject  Communism is so often described as an ideology or a belief that exists somewhere other than in the United States  Let me ask you  sir: just how serious a threat to our national security are these Communist subversive activities in the United States today MR  KENNEDY: w ell  I think they\\'re serious  I think it\\'s a matter that we should continue to uh   give uh   great care and attention to  w e should support uh   the laws which the United States has passed in order to protect us from uh   those who would destroy us from within  w e should sustain uh   the Department of Justice in its efforts and the F B I   and we should be continually alert  I think if the United States is maintaining a strong society here in the United States  I think that we can meet any internal threat  The major threat is external and will continue MR  SMITH: Mr  Nixon  comment MR  NIXON: I agree with Senator Kennedy\\'s appraisal generally in this respect  The question of Communism within the United States has been one that has worried us in the past  It is one that will continue to be a problem for years to come  w e have to remember that the cold war that Mr  Khrushchev is waging and his colleagues are waging  is waged all over the world and it\\'s waged right here in the United States  That\\'s why we have to continue to be alert  It is also essential in being alert that we be fair; fair because by being fair we uphold the very freedoms that the Communists would destroy  w e uphold the standards of conduct which they would never follow  And  in this connection  I think that uh   we must look to the future having in mind the fact that we fight Communism at home not only by our laws to deal with Communists uh   the few who do become Communists and the few who do become tra  fellow travelers  but we also fight Communism at home by moving against those various injustices which exist in our society which the Communists feed upon  And in that connection I again would say that while Senator Kennedy says we are for the status quo  I do believe that he uh   would agree that I am just as sincere in believing that my proposals for federal aid to education  my proposals for health care are just as sincerely held as his  The question again is not one of goals   we\\'re for those goals   it\\'s one of means MR  SMITH: Mr  Vanocur\\'s question for Vice President Nixon MR  VANOCUR: Mr  Vice President uh   in one of your earlier statements you said we\\'ve moved ahead  we\\'ve built more schools  we\\'ve built more hospitals  Now  sir  isn\\'t it true that the building of more schools is a local matter for financing  Uh   w ere you claiming that the Eisenhower Administration was responsible for the building of these schools  or is it the local school districts that provide for it MR  NIXON: Not at all  As a matter of fact your question brings out a point that I am very glad to make  Too often in appraising whether we are moving ahead or not we think only of what the federal government is doing  Now that isn\\'t the test of whether America moves  The test of whether America moves is whether the federal government  plus the state government  plus the local government  plus the biggest segment of all   individual enterprise   moves  w e have for example a gross national product of approximately five hundred billion dollars  Roughly a hundred billion to a hundred and a quarter billion of that is the result of government activity  Four hundred billion  approximately  is a result of what individuals do  Now  the reason the Eisenhower Administration has moved  the reason that we\\'ve had the funds  for example  locally to build the schools  and the hospitals  and the highways  to make the progress that we have  is because this Administration has encouraged individual enterprise; and it has resulted in the greatest expansion of the private sector of the economy that has ever been witnessed in an eight year period  And that is growth  That is the growth that we are looking for; it is the growth that this Administration has supported and that its policies have stimulated MR  SMITH: Senator Kennedy MR  KENNEDY: w ell  I must say that the reason that the schools have been constructed is because the local school districts were willing to increase the property taxes to a tremendously high figure   in my opinion  almost to the point of diminishing returns in order to sustain these schools  Secondly  I think we have a rich uh   country  And I think we have a powerful country  I think what we have to do  however  is have the president and the leadership set before our country exactly what we must do in the next decade  if we\\'re going to maintain our security in education  in economic growth  in development of natural resources  The Soviet Union is making great gains  It isn\\'t enough to compare what might have been done eight years ago  or ten years ago  or fifteen years ago  or twenty years ago  I want to compare what we\\'re doing with what our adversaries are doing  so that by the year 1970 the United States is ahead in education  in health  in building  in homes  in economic strength  I think that\\'s the big assignment  the big task  the big function of the federal government MR  SMITH: Can I have the summation time please  w e\\'ve completed our questions and our comments  and in just a moment  we\\'ll have the summation time VOICE: This will allow three minutes and twenty seconds for the summation by each candidate MR  SM1TH: Three minutes and twenty seconds for each candidate  Vice President Nixon  will you make the first summation MR  NIXON: Thank you  Mr  Smith  Senator Kennedy  First of all  I think it is well to put in perspective where we really do stand with regard to the Soviet Union in this whole matter of growth  The Soviet Union has been moving faster than we have  But the reason for that is obvious  They start from a much lower base  Although they have been moving faster in growth than we have  we find  for example  today that their total gross national product is only forty four per cent of our total gross national product  That\\'s the same percentage that it was twenty years ago  And as far as the absolute gap is concerned  we find that the United States is even further ahead than it was twenty years ago  Is this any reason for complacency  Not at all Because these are determined men  They are fanatical men  And we have to get the very most of uh   out uh   out of our economy  I agree with Senator Kennedy completely on that score  w here we disagree is in the means that we would use to get the most out of our economy  I respectfully submit that Senator Kennedy too often would rely too much on the federal government  on what it would do to solve our problems  to stimulate growth  I believe that when we examine the Democratic platform  when we examine the proposals that he has discussed tonight  when we compare them with the proposals that I have made  that these proposals that he makes would not result in greater growth for this country than would be the case if we followed the programs that I have advocated  There are many of the points that he has made that I would like to comment upon  The one in the field of health is worth mentioning  Our health program   the one that Senator Javits and other Republican Senators  as well as I supported   is one that provides for all people over sixty five who want health insurance  the opportunity to have it if they want it  It provides a choice of having either government insurance or private insurance  But it compels nobody to have insurance who does not want it  His program under Social Security  would require everybody who had Social Security to take government health insurance whether he wanted it or not  And it would not cover several million people who are not covered by Social Security at all  Here is one place where I think that our program does a better job than his  The other point that I would make is this: this downgrading of how much things cost I think many of our people will understand better when they look at what happened when   during the Truman Administration when the government was spending more than it took in   we found savings over a lifetime eaten up by inflation  w e found the people who could least afford it   people on retired incomes uh   people on fixed incomes   we found them unable to meet their bills at the end of the month  It is essential that a man who\\'s president of this country certainly stand for every program that will mean for growth  And I stand for programs that will mean growth and progress  But it is also essential that he not allow a dollar spent that could be better spent by the people themselves MR  SMITH: Senator Kennedy  your conclusion MR  KENNEDY: The point was made by Mr  Nixon that the Soviet production is only forty four percent of ours  I must say that forty four percent and that Soviet country is causing us a good deal of trouble tonight  I want to make sure that it stays in that relationship  I don\\'t want to see the day when it\\'s sixty percent of ours  and seventy and seventy five and eighty and ninety percent of ours  with all the force and power that it could bring to bear in order to cause our destruction  Secondly  the Vice President mentioned medical care for the aged  Our program was an amendment to the Kerr bill  The Kerr bill provided assistance to all those who were not on Social Security  I think it\\'s a very clear contrast  In 1935  when the Social Security Act was written  ninety four out of ninety five Republicans voted against it  Mr  Landon ran in 1936 to repeal it  In August of 1960  when we tried to get it again  but this time for medical care  we received the support of one Republican in the Senate on this occasion  Thirdly  I think the question before the American people is: as they look at this country and as they look at the world around them  the goals are the same for all Americans  The means are at question  The means are at issue  If you feel that everything that is being done now is satisfactory  that the relative power and prestige and strength of the United States is increasing in relation to that of the Communists; that we\\'ve b  gaining more security  that we are achieving everything as a nation that we should achieve  that we are achieving a better life for our citizens and greater strength  then I agree  I think you should vote for Mr  Nixon  But if you feel that we have to move again in the sixties  that the function of the president is to set before the people the unfinished business of our society as Franklin Roosevelt did in the thirties  the agenda for our people   what we must do as a society to meet our needs in this country and protect our security and help the cause of freedom  As I said at the beginning  the question before us all  that faces all Republicans and all Democrats  is: can freedom in the next generation conquer  or are the Communists going to be successful  That\\'s the great issue  And if we meet our responsibilities I think freedom will conquer  If we fail  if we fail to move ahead  if we fail to develop sufficient military and economic and social strength here in this country  then I think that uh   the tide could begin to run against us  And I don\\'t want historians  ten years from now  to say  these were the years when the tide ran out for the United States  I want them to say these were the years when the tide came in; these were the years when the United States started to move again  That\\'s the question before the American people  and only you can decide what you want  what you want this country to be  what you want to do with the future  I think we\\'re ready to move  And it is to that great task  if we\\'re successful  that we will address ourselves MR  SMITH: Thank you very much  gentlemen  This hour has gone by all too quickly  Thank you very much for permitting us to present the next president of the United States on this unique program  I\\'ve been asked by the candidates to thank the American networks and the affiliated stations for providing time and facilities for this joint appearance  Other debates in this series will be announced later and will be on different subjects  This is Howard K  Smith  Good night from Chicago ']"
